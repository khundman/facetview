Regarding societal applications and the building of necessary capacity to harness satellite earth observations, there are 5 key questions that the applications and capacity building community has identified recently at a workshop meeting held in Tacoma (June 23-25, 2015). These are: 1.What types of value-added products/information should we provide for resource-constrained public and national stakeholder communities and agencies?  2.What types of industry or private-sector partnership will most benefit the scientific research needed to meet societal needs?  3.How can we leverage the combined observational power of our many Earth observing satellite missions (current and future) in a synergistic manner to rapidly multiply societal applications? 4.How do we make the scientific innovation from satellite remote sensing data trigger durable and robust applications that do not require long-term incubation or external support?  5.From an economic standpoint, what should be the optimal business model between scientific communities and the stakeholders to support a sustainable partnership? A full report is available on the key findings, community-wide recommendations as well as key questions/challenges broken down thematically and geographically at the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/seopjch0ftukiln/Capacity%20Building%20E2%20Decadal%20Survey%20NASA%20Workshop%20Report%20v5.doc?dl=0 The specific themes addressed in the above report are: 1.public health and air quality; 2. disaster management; 3. ecosystems function; 4. water resources; 5. food and agriculture; 6. cross-cutting issues. Interested reader will find theme-specific and region-specific recommendations and key questions in the full workshop report linked above. In addition, we wish to draw the attention of the NRC Decadal Survey panel to pages 57-62 of the workshop report linked above. Those pages have the community-based input for prioritization of future 2007 Decadal Survey missions that are not yet in planning stages and recommended funding breakdown. Lastly, we wish to draw the attention of NRC Decadal Survey panel on three forthcoming wide-audience publications related to applications and capacity building of satellite earth observations. These are: 1) A Global Capacity Building Vision for Societal Applications of Earth Observing Systems and Data: Key Questions and Recommendations, Bulletin of American Meteorological Society, (available online at: http://www.saswe.net/publications/PostWorkshopBAMS.pdf) 2) Data for all: Using satellite observations for social good, EOS (AGU) (available online at: https://eos.org/opinions/data-for-all-using-satellite-observations-for-social-good and pdf at http://www.saswe.net/publications/PreWorkshopEOS.pdf)   3) Globalizing Societal Applications of Scientific Research and Observations from Remote Sensing: The Path Forward (Meeting Report), EOS (AGU) (in press; available online at http://www.saswe.net/publications/PostWorkshopEOS.pdf)  Q.2 Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? The above questions (identified in Q.1) are timely to address because of sustainability and the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by more than 180 nations in 2015. As stated by NRC, “Understanding the complex, changing planet on which we live, how it supports life, and how human activities affect its ability to do so in the future is one of the greatest intellectual challenges facing humanity.” To continue. “It is also one of the most important for society as it seeks to achieve prosperity and sustainability.”  Sustainable livelihoods with human and economic development, as envisioned in the SDG, can only be made possible in a context of food security, water availability and environmental health. Societal applications of satellite earth observations should therefore be developed to monitor and support progress towards these goals. In developing regions of the world and in many regions of the developed world, easy access to safe water means reduced malnutrition, morbidity and child mortality, as well as time and the opportunity for girls, and children in general, to attend school. Health and food security are dependent on water availability and ecosystem health, which in turn is highly influenced by local resource management strategies. Disaster risk is modulated by land use cover and the ability of ecosystems to provide regulating and provisioning services. Because of the integrated nature of human-natural systems (and the need for environment-water-health-livelihoods sustainability/security), societal applications must draw on the combined observational power of different sensors and remote sensing products at adequate resolutions in space and time. While research and retrospective products enable useful hindsight, operational real-time products are essential to support present decisions and strategies that can positively impact mankind more positively and sooner. Earth scientists must work with the practitioner and stakeholder communities to best tackle the challenges on the ground and develop new innovative efforts ranging through large missions, the use of nanosatellites or crowdsourcing feedbacks.  Given the above, the science community that is reliant on earth observation data from remote sensing for exploring earth science has a responsibility to regularly update and prioritize societally-relevant scientific questions and the Earth observations required to answer them. It is for these reasons cited above that the five key questions highlighted under Question 1 are considered important for forging a global capacity vision for harnessing the value of earth observations for benefit of all mankind in the coming decade. Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? Satellite remote sensing offers a unique global observational platform for pursuing societal benefits in ways that are not feasible using only conventional ground-based approaches. Reaping these benefits requires an intimate engagement between the scientific community and a wide range of stakeholders. This issue has taken on a new urgency, as the strong interplay between human activity and nature drives change on almost all continents, with rules set by human activities as well as nature.  The pursuit of a more sustainable, safer, and happier future drives the study of planet Earth, with its changing environmental conditions and natural resources. Observations from visible, laser, infrared, and microwave satellite sensors already provide information for managing land, water, agriculture, energy, disaster response, and ecosystem functions. During the last few decades, we have been quite successful in taking advantage of the science and observations afforded by satellites to make spectacular societal impacts. We are gradually developing a plethora of more mature remote sensing technology missions for routine environmental monitoring. These include Landsat and altimetry missions, hydrologic missions like Global Precipitation Measurement, NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission, and NASA's anticipated Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission. However, we lack much of the capacity required to handle the petabyte-scale influx of satellite environmental data that will become available.  Earth observations from remote sensing continue to be an underused resource for humanity with applications mostly limited to important scientific research.  To take advantage of satellite observational capability to enhance and accelerate societal applications around the world, scientists and other stakeholders must collaborate to find answers in the coming decade. Time is of the essence, as long gestation periods, sometimes decades, are often necessary to transition from scientific research to real-world benefits for stakeholders.  Thus far, the benefits of satellite earth observations have mostly accrued in the developed nations of Europe and North America. Global satellite observational coverage would be especially useful in the developing world because ground‐based measurements are often largely absent here. However, programs to apply satellite observations to challenges in the developing world often struggle for longevity and continuity. Also, the combined observational power of the multiple Earth-observing satellites too often places emphasis on the benefits from individual missions and observing systems. This observational power is currently not being harnessed to produce more durable societal benefits. The struggle for support and survival has often pitted various missions against each other. This competition ignores the synergistic power and benefits that combining data from the many Earth-observing satellites could provide, missing an opportunity to provide even more spectacular societal benefits. Our current and future satellite constellation essentially provides us with a `compound eye` view of the world. Like the composite eye of a fly, coordinated satellites look with many eyes at the same time to see the world from many different angles, using an array of instruments. To take advantage of this composite view is to make better decisions, using an application that is wired to expect and accept all the different observations across multiple platforms simultaneously. Such a capability could be used to address upcoming issues in water management, or agricultural production.  For all these reasons, satellite remote sensing of the earth is fundamental to achieving global-scale sustainable development for all mankind as envisioned by the NRC in its 2005 Interim Decadal Survey report.  4  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"aleix serrat-capdevila::stephanie granger::david ganz::msr murthy::victor ramos::eric anderson::guy schumann::dalia kirschbaum::vanessa escobar::margaret srinivasan::christine lee::naveed iqbal::nancy searby::africa flores::carolyn fonseca::ashutosh limaye::tim stough::sue estes::ali akanda::"}

The workshop was sponsored by the NASA Applied Sciences Program as an E2 Topical Workshop, Symposium and Conference (TWSC) event. The workshop brought together experts from the applied sciences community across various themes already engaged in capacity building for the stakeholder community; NASA Applied Science and capacity building programmatic personnel; and several international stakeholder agencies with a history of using and a need for earth observation systems and data.  One of the many things the community worked on was the creation of a set of graphics that captures the spirit and a future vision for satellite applications and capacity building for societal good. Figure 1 on next page provides this visual essence of earth observation-based global capacity building and applications. This graphic was created with input provided from various workshop attendees. It conveys the need for a more holistic use of the combined observational power of multiple satellites. This concept, coined as ‘compound eye’, may be considered analogous to the A-train concept, except that herein we are focused on an ‘A-train’ for applications. During the workshop, the term ‘Compound Eye’ of EO systems (satellites) was used to capture the key question (posed in preceding paragraph) more succinctly.   The scope of the opportunity and abundance of satellite observations confronting us in the not-too-distant future is already apparent. A-train is a series of coordinated satellites passes over the same region in quick succession, using 15 instruments to monitor various aspects of Earth's atmosphere. The best use of the system requires a holistic use of the combined observational power of all of these satellites. Our current and future satellite constellation essentially provides us with a `compound eye` view of the world. Like the composite eye of a fly, coordinated satellites look with many eyes at the same time to see the world from many different angles, using an array of instruments.  To take advantage of this composite view is to make better decisions, using an application that is wired to expect and accept all the different observations across multiple platforms simultaneously. Such a capability could be used to address upcoming issues in water management, for example. As we move forward, we must harness this compound eye view provided by multiple satellite missions rather than focus on single mission to achieve greater benefit for society. The applications and capacity building community also presented theme-specific graphics to make the point on how the combined observational power of satellites can achieve greater benefits for society than a single mission. Figure 2 illustrates how a coordinated group of satellites can be used in surface water management. Figure 3 illustrates a similar case for agricultural crop production and consumptive use.

Including perspectives from a range of stakeholders (both research and operational), it is designed to provide the rationale and information required for future planning and investment. The full background and recommendations are available as a forthcoming publication, which should be consulted rather than this white paper, if possible. The Southern Ocean is vast but globally connected, and the communities that require satellite-derived data in the region are diverse. It has a profound influence on the global ocean circulation and the Earth’s climate. It uniquely connects the Earth’s ocean basins and plays a key role in global overturning circulation, thereby regulating the capacity of the ocean to store and transport heat, carbon, and other properties that influence climate and global biogeochemical cycles. Global climate and sea level are influenced strongly by ocean-cryosphere interactions in the Southern Ocean. Changes in sea-ice extent or volume result in changes in the Earth's albedo, water mass formation rates, air-sea gas exchange rates, and effects on marine organisms from microbes to whales.  The Southern Ocean is vast and in situ observations will likely always be sparse and hard to obtain, thus space-based data are crucial for studying and understanding the Southern Ocean. While many existing missions collect data over the Southern Ocean (i.e., polar-orbiting satellites), this review identified significant areas for improvement in the coming decade.  The communities that require satellite-derived data in the Southern Ocean are diverse. Through extensive community engagement, this review has endeavoured to bring together both the current best practice and future needs of a wide range of stakeholders, including observational scientists, modellers, and Southern Ocean operators. As one survey respondent astutely noted: “[Researchers] work with what we have available. The more we have available, the better the research in general.” This is not to say that researchers are greedy – but instead that more and better satellite data will systematically contribute to improved science and deeper understanding of the Southern Ocean, a critical component of the global climate system yet one that has historically been under-observed and understood.  Important observable variable include sea ice properties (extent, concentration, thickness, edge, snow loading, motion, and charting), sea surface temperature, iceberg, sea surface height, atmospheric parameters, marine microbe observations, marine biology and related activities, terrestrial cryospheric connections, sea surface salinity, and air-sea gas exchange. Challenges are often quite specific to the parameter of interest. For example: · For sea ice concentration, radiometric signatures for areas with thin ice tend to overlap with open water signatures, leading to underestimation. · When thick snow cover on sea ice in the Southern Ocean causes flooding in the interface between the sea ice and snow, it introduces ambiguities when interpreting sea-ice concentration, extent, and thickness from satellite-derived data. · For many data sources, limited bandwidth available to transmit data restricts data collection. · Spatial and temporal resolution both limit the utility of sea surface temperature observations. · Existing altimeters remain ambiguous in the Southern Ocean due to the sea state (i.e., presence of sea ice or large waves) and lack of knowledge on how altimeter waveforms are tracked in these settings. · Atmospheric profilers also have difficulty detecting and quantifying low level clouds and precipitation. · Many relevant sensors collecting data (on atmospheric properties) are nearing or exceeding a decade old. · The unique bio-optics, microbial community structure and photo-physiology, lack of regularly verified and operationalized products, the physical location, and the scarcity of in situ samples for verification are major limitations to the development and use of ocean color remote sensing in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. · One of the major limitations for iceberg monitoring is that iceberg movement can have varying speeds due to ocean and atmospheric forcings. It is difficult to detect an iceberg at the scale of approximately <5 m long unless the user has prior knowledge of its existence and specifically orders high resolution data to follow its trajectory.  · Polar ocean waters are cold and L-band radar observations are less sensitive to salinity in cold waters. In addition, salinity retrieval is less accurate for very rough sea surfaces. Finally, the presence of sea ice and icebergs in the sensors’ field of view adds complexity to the monitoring of SSS in the high latitudes. · In the Southern Ocean, the presence of sea ice can affect scatterometer measurements to wind velocities and directions. In addition, the presence of liquid precipitation can also contaminate wind measurements.  · In terms of data availability, while RapidSCAT on board the International Space Station (launched in 2014) is seen as a replacement for the Ku-band SeaWinds, it only includes coverage up to ~58°S. Therefore, a largest limitation to remote sensing of Southern Ocean wind velocities and directions is a lack of Ku-band scatterometry data. The planned CFOSat will be able to remedy this data gap, with its planned launch in 2018.   Based upon survey responses and subsequent community consultation, this review includes many recommendations for the future of Southern Ocean remote sensing including, in no particular order, to: · Commit to continuity of all satellite data workhorses (using quantitative standards to determine the quality and quantity of data needed to observe trends), including visible imagers, ocean color sensors, scatterometers, passive microwave sensors, and active radar sensors (note: continuity may possibly be interrupted if a timeseries is long and precise enough that a statistical level of certainty in observations is reached),  · Coordinate a combined campaign by (European) states, many of whom are signatories to the Antarctic Treaty, to ask for satellite data coverage of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, · Clarify acquisition and data sharing plans for Southern Ocean satellite data across agencies,  · Increase the spatial and temporal resolution (potentially with the inclusion of non-sun-synchronous orbits) of key parameters identified above (within physical, engineering, and budgetary constraints),  · Create a systematic, synoptic ice charting system for the entire Southern Ocean, · Increase availability of Ku-band scatterometer data, · Support the development of Southern Ocean-specific algorithms for essential climate variables and derived parameters,  · Implement widespread, multi-sensor, consistent calibration and validation for campaigns for important products in the Southern Ocean,  · Encourage innovation in development of (automated) ancillary data collection (e.g. through the use of ships of opportunity and autonomous platforms), · Facilitate and support operationalization of researcher-led product and algorithm development with agency support, and implement pipelines for continuously updated datasets wherever they are held, as possible,  · Provide useable uncertainty estimates / documentation along with all products, · Improve atmospheric correction models for high-latitude use,  · Consider investing in hyperspectral satellite data for polar regions, · Consider a joint laser and radar altimetry mission for sea ice and ice sheets, · Reduce the cost and increase the availability of (high-resolution) SAR data for the Southern Ocean community (using free and commercial optical imagery as an example), · Collect more multifrequency (Wide Swath) SAR imagery (especially L-band), · Focus on both widespread, long-term monitoring, process-based studies (e.g., polynyas or marginal ice zone), and areas of environmental and human activity (e.g., Amundsen-Bellingshausen region, Weddell Sea, Antarctic Peninsula), and to  · Commit to best practice in fast, easy, centralized, and comprehensive data access (both scientific and operational) and use (i.e., multiple levels of products and tools) for all Southern Ocean stakeholders.  A theme across all Southern Ocean satellite applications is the need for coincident data collection, including the need for coincident data for calibration and validation of satellite-derived products, as well as coincidently collected satellite data required to fully observe the interdependent variables of complex systems. Survey respondents identified the desire for in situ measurements of almost every remotely sensed parameter for product calibration and validation; a time window of +/-3 hours between in situ and satellite observations was identified in one survey response. In addition to in situ measurements, survey respondents identified significant added value by combining multiple remote sensing datasets. In order to bridge the gap to low-resolution synoptic observations, there need to be efforts made to collect both high resolution and low resolution data coincidentally (within the limits of the type of data being collected). Examples of implementing this suggestion include planning near-synchronous orbits for satellite constellations or timing airborne data collections to overlap with satellite overpasses. Further innovating in planning on this front is necessary. There are many similarities between Arctic and Antarctic/Southern Ocean remote sensing, but different geographical settings do introduce unique challenges to each. Although differences exist in the validity and accuracy of specific algorithms and corrections between the northern and southern hemisphere polar oceans, data requirements are largely the same. However, some missions focus acquisitions and data analysis predominantly on Arctic objectives, following political/national priorities of the key data providers. We hope that this white paper provides a starting point for understand remote sensing of the Southern Ocean and its global role. More information is available from SOOS, CliC and the full report.                                                        /docProps/thumbnail.jpeg  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"robert johnson::"}

Currently, surface air pressure can only be   observed by in-situ measurements in limited ground stations over land and very-sparsely over   oceans. There are no global and regional observations of surface air pressure fields.  This   observational gap in surface air pressure generates significant problems in GHG volume mixing   ratio measurements [1].  For example, current GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites and the future   ASCENDS space mission can measure column CO2 amounts.  However, they need modelled (or   assimilated) surface air pressure fields to convert the measured CO2 column amounts to CO2   volume mixing ratio (XCO2) [2][3].  For this conversion, a critical part of surface air pressure is   dry air pressure since wet air part can be observed well by current satellite column water vapor   measurement capabilities.  Because of large sizes of grid boxes of global models and limited   constraints in the models over remote land regions and open seas especially the southern ocean,   significant errors in surface air pressure fields could be introduced in the areas of satellite column   CO2 measurements, which would lead considerable uncertainties in estimated XCO2.  Many   active and passive optical remote sensing approaches such as those operating on O2 A-bands for   surface dry air pressure have been considered in last three decades or so.  None is satisfactory [4].    An example is for the passive O2 A-band measurements from the OCO-2 spacecraft.  These   measurements are very sensitive to thin clouds and aerosols.  Thus, no reliable surface air pressure   can be retrieved from passive O2 A-band sensors even in clear conditions.  Recent progress in   surface dry air barometry using microwave O2-band Differential-absorption BArometric Radar   (DiBAR) provides a great potential for surface air pressure remote sensing especially over oceans   [4].  The DiBAR system will meet the accuracy and precision requirements of space CO2 missions   at suitable small spatial scales [4][5]. The DiBAR technology developed will also enable NASA   and the nation to significantly improve severe weather, especially hurricane, forecasts with its   remotely sensed sea surface barometric pressure fields [6][7][8].  The development of the DiBAR   technology potentially has tremendous impacts on socioeconomics [9].       Because of the changes in GHG and climate, and the extreme importance of tropical storm   forecasts for the society, rapid progress in DiBAR technology and preparing surface barometric   mission are critical for NASA and the nation.  Recently NASA Langley Research Center has     formulated a surface barometry concept, developed a DiBAR system design, fabricated a   Prototype-DiBAR (P-DiBAR) instrument for proof-of-concept, and conducted lab, ground and   low altitude aircraft tests of the P-DiBAR instrument. The flight test results clearly demonstrate   the consistency between theoretical analyses of the DiBAR concept and remote sensing   measurements of the barometric pressure radar, and show that current DiBAR technology provide   a great potential of global precise surface air pressure measurements from space [5][6][9].              Answers to the key questions of RFI:   a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities   necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If   not, what additional investments are needed?    Answer: Existing and planned U.S. and international programs will not provide the capabilities   necessary to make substantial progress on the global surface air pressure measurements.  The   scientific issues related to GHG volume mixing ratio observations could not be solved   fundamentally if no space barometry missions are conducted.  With current progress in DiBAR   technology, additional investments in development of high altitude airborne DiBAR systems for   space mission demonstration and validation are needed to improve the technology readiness level   (TRL) of the DiBAR concept for space barometry missions.    b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for   addressing key scientific questions and societal needs   Answer: Global surface air pressure measurements from space could be combined with other   critical satellite meteorological measurements such as temperature, humidity and wind to   increase accuracy of the forecasts of atmospheric basic states and to provide broad applications   for carbon, water and energy, and weather sciences.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits    Answer: Space barometry missions using DiBAR technology will improve carbon sink, source   and transport estimations, significantly reduce errors in tropical storm and severe weather   predictions, shrink uncertainties in predictions of future climate, and increase confidence in   climate/carbon related policies.    d. The science communities that would be involved.    Answer: Science communities in weather, climate, water and energy cycle, and carbon cycle will   be involved.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? A key challenge for operational weather forecasting is making timely, credible, location-specific, severe weather warnings.  While warning on forecast lead times for mid-continental severe weather have been roughly doubled recently by making better use of existing data (see Section 1.b.), frequent measurements containing more information about pre-storm atmospheric stability and moisture gradients, both horizontal and vertical, are needed to move from warning times of order tens of minutes to warnings of greater than an hour. The high value of earlier warnings for protecting people and property is made shockingly apparent during every tornado season in the mid-section of the United States. Collecting the required rapid sampling information (order of minutes) with high spatial resolution and continental scale coverage is a job for satellite-based observations from geosynchronous orbit, clearly making this a challenge for joint action by NASA and NOAA (The NASA Authorization Act of 2015 states that “[NASA] shall continue to develop first-of-a-kind instruments that, once proved, can be transitioned to other agencies for operations”). A space-borne system to answer this challenge was highly recommended in the 2007 Decadal Survey, but unfortunately it became “the forgotten recommendation”.  The Survey strongly supported implementing an advanced imaging sounder that would provide high resolution spectra of Earth emitted radiances from which high vertical resolution temperature and water vapor profiles could be obtained on an imaging grid with 4-5 km pixels covering about 500 km squares in 12 seconds.   Specifically, the Executive Summary on pages 5-6 stated that “NOAA should restore several key climate, environmental, and weather observation capabilities to its planned NPOESS and GOES-R missions; namely:” followed by 4 bullets. The 4th was “Develop a strategy to restore the previously planned capability to make high-temporal- and high-vertical-resolution measurements of temperature and water vapor from geosynchronous orbit,” followed by: “the committee recommends consideration of the following approaches: · Working with NASA, complete the GIFTS instrument, deliver it to orbit via a cost-effective launch and spacecraft opportunity, and evaluate its potential to be a prototype for the HES instrument, and/or [the Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) is a NASA sponsored prototype built with New Millennium Program support] · Extend the HES study contracts focusing on cost-effective approaches to achieving essential sounding capabilities to be flown in the GOES-R time frame.”  While these specific approaches may no longer be applicable, these statements show how seriously the implementation of these “essential sounding capabilities” was taken.  The operational need is still unmet, and a joint commitment by NASA and NOAA should be made to fill the void.  Also, the detailed industry studies of the Hyper-spectral Environmental Suite (HES) instrument design are available for providing cost and risk information for the new Decadal Survey (See section 1.a.).  Regarding the efficacy of the high vertical resolution information from high spectral resolution IR data, the case has been made even more strongly than was known when the earlier survey was written, a time when the NASA EOS AIRS was relatively young.  Since then two new types of advanced polar-orbiting, operational sounders have been successfully vetted (IASI on MetOP A and B starting in 2006 and 2012, and CrIS on Suomi NPP starting in 2012). ECMWF has ranked the forecast impact of each individual hyper-spectral IR sounder to be higher than that of any other single instrument, highlighting the value of increased vertical resolution.  This performance from polar orbit clearly demonstrates the capability of this type of measurement for determining atmospheric stability from GEO.  a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?  There are no credible plans to fly a GIFTS- or HES-like instrument with coverage over the United States. While two commercial ventures have received licenses from the Department of Commerce permitting them to provide this capability worldwide (GeoMetWatch, and Tempus),  these endeavors have become bogged down in legal issues, have not demonstrated the availability of necessary financial resources, and cannot now be relied on for timely and predictable implementation.    No other type of observation, existing or planned, can perform the rapid atmospheric stability observations on the fine spatial scale possible from geostationary orbit.  The capabilities of this type of instrument are unique.  Polar high spectral resolution sounders have inadequate temporal coverage. GPS-RO has inadequate spatial resolution (as well as temporal resolution currently). The present GOES sounder has inadequate vertical resolution and is not being continued on GOES-R. The GOES-R imager has inadequate vertical resolution, as would a future geosynchronous microwave sounder.  Comparing GIFTS to the present GOES sounder, the vertical resolution is 3 times higher, the spatial footprint area is 6.3 times smaller (4 km compared to 10 km), and the temporal coverage is 5.5 times faster; yielding a factor of 100 more detail in space and time.   Other countries are pursuing this capability, but of course this will not provide coverage over the US.  China is planning to fly a series of Geostationary Interferometer Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) instruments on FY-4 (A in 2016, B in 2018, C in 2020) with capability approaching that of GIFTS by FY-4C.  Also, a European advanced IR sounder (IRS) similar to GIFTS will be a key part of Meteosat Third Generation with a planned sounder launch in about 2021. We expect these efforts to succeed, but clearly they will not fulfill the needs for severe weather warnings in the US and will not fulfill WMO recommendations for a global constellation of advanced Geostationary IR Sounders. Regarding the additional investments needed, credible cost estimates were produced under the NOAA/NASA HES program.  It is our understanding that the cost for 4 instruments was on the order of $ ½ B and that there were no high risks.  Specifically, the 2007 NOAA Analysis of Alternatives after the GOES-R sounder was de-manifested categorized (1) Performance, (2) Space Development/Integration, (2) Schedule for 2014 free flyer, and (4) Ground System to all be low risk and the cost risk for demo mode to be moderate.  The Decadal Survey should strongly recommend a NASA pathfinder to reduce cost risks for the ultimate NOAA operational system. b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs A new approach developed as a NOAA/CIMSS research product called ProbSevere is a great example of increasing the value of data by combining space-based and other observations to address the key challenge of improving severe storm warning times.  ProbSevere uses optimum estimation on historic weather records to extract the information needed to produce earlier warnings from a combination of radar, NWP, and GOES data.  It has been demonstrated to roughly double warning times by adding an extra 10 minutes.  While a hugely positive development, significantly longer warn on forecast times would clearly be extremely valuable, and adding advanced sounder data to ProbSevere may be a good approach when they becomes available. c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits The anticipated societal benefits of the advanced sounder are tied to the protection offered to life and property by forecasts with more accurately located regions of severe weather, issued over an hour in advance of tornadic and other life threatening events.  An OSSE based on WRF model simulations on a 2 km grid with realistic clouds for 12-13 June 2002 has demonstrated these extended warning times. Comparisons of advanced sounder performance were made with model truth, GOES-R imager performance, and radar; using lifted index less than -9 as the indicator of likely severe weather for the satellite data.  The advanced sounder (1) significantly reduced false alarms from using GOES-R imager data, (2) provided substantially better location agreement with truth, (3) began seeing evidence for severe weather even eight hours before the radar started to detect rain, and (4) provided an accurate depiction of severe instability several hours in advance of severe weather. It is expected that the implementation of improved forecasts will initially use a technique called nearcasting that makes use of model winds combined with measured stability, and will transition to using data assimilation techniques for regional models. d. The science communities that would be involved.  The advanced sounder approach to addressing this key challenge would clearly involve the communities connected to NOAA weather research and satellite data product developments, along with NASA Earth System Science and instrument development, and university atmospheric sciences and remote sensing expertise. 2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? This highly valuable capability is seriously overdue.  Readiness was proven by the GIFTS prototype and supplemented by the HES industry studies and demonstrations. And we are falling behind the rest of the world in this arena that we pioneered. 3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Space-based observations from geosynchronous orbit are especially well suited to providing the detailed and comprehensive spatial coverage and rapid sampling needed to meet this challenge.   While planning for GOES-R, NOAA sponsored cost/benefit studies that documented the large expected value of the system and about half of the benefits were attributed to the sounder, not present on the current system.  The sounder will help reach the goal of a “Weather Ready Nation`, which will not be met until storm warning lead times are extended into hours.

Collins, Daniel Feldman, Brian Soden, Steven A. Ackerman  1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? A fundamental question for Earth System Science is: How is the climate of the Earth changing on decadal time scales?  Quantitative, global answers to this question will form an important part of the foundation needed for very difficult governmental policy decisions that are now expected to require significant societal changes to avoid dire consequences for future generations.  Therefore, a key challenge for NASA is to make spaceborne measurements with the information content and accuracy needed to quantify decadal scale climate trends for major regions all across the globe. This White Paper addresses the first step urgently needed in the next decade: an observatory to establish a global benchmark of the current climate from space.  The term “benchmark” is used to convey an extremely accurate measure that provides a reference from which future benchmark observations can be judged to establish accurate trends.  In simple terms, it is a global version of a stake used to mark the extent of a glacier. This benchmarking objective was one of the principal drivers of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission that was chosen as one of four Tier 1 missions in the 2007 Decadal Survey.  The key elements of CLARREO that in combination set it far apart from existing systems are (1) high information content about temperature and water vapor profile distributions, trace gases, and cloud and surface properties from measuring a large part of the reflected solar and the emitted radiance spectra at high spectral resolution, (2) state-of the-art measurement accuracy (0.4%  reflected solar radiance, 0.1 K emitted brightness temperature, both 3-sigma) proven on-orbit with SI international reference standards, and (3) spatial sampling strategy chosen to minimize biases for regional climate products so as to not significantly degrade the measurement accuracy. Highlights include emission spectra that cover a major part of the Far IR spectrum (extending out to 50 microns, a region not sampled by existing spaceflight observations), new technologies specifically developed under NASA Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) efforts to verify expected accuracy on-orbit, the use of truly polar orbits (90 degree inclination) to reduce sampling biases, and inclusion of GPS radio-occultation observations for independent, highly accurate refractivity (0.1%, 3-sigma for 5-20 km altitude) constraints on temperature trends that are not influenced by carbon dioxide, ozone, or upper level water vapor trends.  a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?  The existing national and international complement of Earth observing systems does not include benchmarking measurements capable of unequivocally establishing how the climate is changing on decadal time scales. By acquiring observations with improved absolute accuracies, CLARREO benchmark measurements can quantify climate trends on shorter time scales. Current systems used for climate observing fall into three general categories, (1) observing systems designed to study weather and climate processes, (2) systems to measure the trends of specific properties, and (3) Earth radiation budget observing systems.  None of the Category 1 systems have the unbiased temporal and spatial sampling, the ultra-high measurement accuracy proven on-orbit, and the high information content about the climate state necessary to satisfy this key challenge. Category 2 systems like IceSat and Jason for observing changes in ice cover and sea level are very important, but do not provide the detailed global constraints needed to distinguish broader aspects of climate models such as radiative effects from cloud cover and land use changes. While much has been learned from the series of Earth radiation budget systems (Category 3), it is now recognized that as currently implemented these systems are unable to address this crucial question.   One of the key limitations is the lack of detailed information provided by these systems.  Ever since the first radiation budget experiment flown by Verner Suomi on Explorer VII in 1959, these systems (ERB, ERBE, CERES) have provided measurements of broad-band reflected solar and infrared emitted fluxes or radiances.  That is, these systems were designed to measure radiative properties integrated over the whole solar spectrum and the whole radiation spectrum (or at best, adding a large IR window band).  The idea was essentially to do a calorimetry experiment whereby the incoming and outgoing energy balance was measured.  While a sound concept, this approach does not capture most of the detailed information about climate present in the spectrally resolved radiation field and does not have the sensitivity to detect climate trends.  In addition, these systems have not had the proven absolute accuracy necessary to establish a benchmark, and thereby have suffered significant uncertainties from temporal observing gaps. The problem with relying on the NASA CLARREO program to accomplish this important role is that there is still no definite commitment to a mission budget or schedule.  The investment required to conduct a cost constrained, but complete, CLARREO benchmark mission has been estimated by NASA in the range $400-500 M.  Alternative international partnerships are also under consideration. The good news about the CLARREO implementation effort is that a low cost, risk reduction mission ($77M) was included in the President’s 2016 Budget and has made it to the execution phase of the NASA Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  This Pathfinder Mission has been designed for the International Space Station (ISS) and is expected to be able to demonstrate (1) the new technologies developed for CLARREO, (2) successful inter-calibration of radiances from other major scientific and operational instruments (to improve their calibrations and allow inclusion in benchmarking), and (3) the start of a significantly improved climate benchmark.  This pathfinder mission would build extra confidence in the technologies and costs associated with the full mission.  However, whether the pathfinder happens or not, there needs to be a commitment to start the full mission as soon as possible. b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs The link between CLARREO benchmark data and a wide range of other data types is the climate model.  Conventional and spaceborne data are used to initialize climate models and the measurements from the original and subsequent benchmarks will be used to test model validity.  This is the process by which climate forecasts will be continuously improved over the decades of the next century. c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits Dealing with climate change is certainly expected to be one of society’s largest challenges in the current century.  Our understanding of the climate threat and progress made by societal changes is going to depend on having forecasts from climate models that are as accurate as possible.  Knowledge of model accuracy will depend on having data that can be used for thorough testing of these models.  The observations themselves will provide definitive proof that change is happening, along with how and where. d. The science communities that would be involved.  The NASA funded CLARREO Science Definition Team is representative of the diverse range of science communities that should be involved.  The team includes people from NASA, NOAA and NIST government laboratories, and universities with representation of talent related to scientific data analysis, mission planning, remote sensing, instrument design, metrology, radiative transfer, climate modeling, and climate change. 2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Clearly Earth System Science observations have already begun to find irrefutable evidence that significant changes are occurring in certain aspects of the climate of Earth.  Therefore, now is the time to lay down a sensitive benchmark from which to take the full measure of global changes. Fortunately, a robust approach for providing an observatory to benchmark the climate has been developed by the NASA CLARREO program that marshalled NASA and community research in support of the climate mission defined in the 2007 Decadal Survey. Over the last decade extensive preparations for the required observatory have brought the scientific basis, the required new technologies, and the detailed design to a high level of readiness.  The paper laying out the scientific basis and design of the mission (Wielicki, et al., Achieving Climate Change Absolute Accuracy in Orbit, BAMS, 2013) won NASA Langley’s Henry J. E. Reid award for its best paper based on the importance of the problem, significance of the contribution, originality of the concept, and quality of the reporting.  Also, development and testing efforts have brought all of the required new technologies to the NASA Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 required by mission Preliminary Design Review. 3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  The simplest rationale for requiring space-based observations is that the whole Earth needs to be monitored to test comparisons with global climate models. In addition, space-based observations are the only way to observe the fundamental reflected solar and emitted radiance spectra that depict the response of the Earth system to solar forcing and characterize key aspects of the resulting climate state. The ability to conduct climate benchmarking to address this fundamental question and key challenge has been very well defined by the CLARREO program and related NASA supported developments and deserves a very strong recommendation for proceeding to execution from the 2017 Decadal Survey. 4-RevercombHenryE1  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"bruce wielicki::stephen leroy::fred best::david tobin::robert knuteson::joe taylor::william smith::nadia smith::john dykema::martin mlynczak::david johnson::peter pilewskie::greg kopp::william collins::daniel feldman::brian soden::steven ackerman::"}

Introduction:  Key questions for Earth System Science in the coming decade.    Earth’s cold regions are changing rapidly and fundamentally altering our understanding  of how future changes will impact human activity at all latitudes (Chapters 2c, 5 and 6 in  [1]).  Diminishing arctic sea ice cover is altering plans for commercial exploration for  natural resources, commercial shipping, and a range of military operations.  Fluxes of  fresh melt-water from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as well as glaciers and ice  caps in the Arctic are primary contributors to rising global sea level.  Shrinking  permafrost cover changes arctic land-erosion patterns and contributes to release into the  atmosphere of methane, an important greenhouse gas.  Rapid changes in the planet’s  seasonal snow cover are raising the planet’s overall albedo, and releasing snowmelt  earlier in the season, before it is needed by local water management agencies.    Prior to the last Decadal Survey for Earth Science, the key cryospheric questions were  cast in terms of the state of the cryosphere and how it was changing [Chapter 9 in [2]).   But as suggested above, subsequent observations well document the dramatic change  presently being witnessed.  Consequently, at issue now is how fast will changes in ocean  and land ice progress and what should be the human response to these changes.  To  answer these questions and to provide improved predictability, sustained observations of  snow and ice mass, extent, surface topography, motion, and surface temperature are  essential from several, proven, spaceborne instruments.  Similarly, unique and  complementary airborne observations of snow and ice thickness are a crucial part of the  observational mix.  Finally, a new generation of observing tools is also necessary to  acquire geophysical information on parameters important to cryospheric models but are  so far only sparsely measured in situ – in particular subsurface temperature [3].  This  white-paper introduces a new concept of low-frequency, multi-channel microwave  radiometry that should be one of the tools considered to address a variety of geophysical  products, including sub-surface temperature and other physical properties of ice sheets,  sea ice, permafrost, and seasonal snow cover. It is also noted that such a system can  provide advantages in the measurement of other land quantities as well, such as sub- surface soil moisture and vegetation biomass.     2    2. Timeliness and Readiness to Address Key Questions    To address the issue of a changing cryosphere and to provide improved predictability,  sustained observations are absolutely essential from several proven instruments (synthetic  aperture radar, lidar altimetry, imaging radiometers, gravimeters).  The climate records  obtained from these spaceborne sensors are crucial benchmarks demonstrating the far  reaching impacts of climate change.      Given the successes of the Aquarius, SMOS and SMAP L-band radiometers, a new set of  measurement capabilities is now maturing.  Observations from those single band  instruments have been applied to studies of sea ice and ice sheets, and may be useful for  studying seasonal snow.  These missions have also motivated design and development of  a new generation of low-frequency, multi-channel radiometers operating at frequencies  less than 2 GHz that promise to fill basic knowledge gaps about the subsurface regime of  icy regions [4].  The prospect of transitioning from single frequency (1.4 GHz)  radiometers to multiple frequency channels (< 2 GHz) comes from recent progress in  radio frequency interference mitigation techniques for operating in these bands.  The  success of the RFI processor in the SMAP mission, as well as continued technology  developments, indicate that observations in frequencies below the protected 1.4 GHz  band should be possible in the future, particularly in the cryosphere.     3. Fundamental Attributes of Space-based observations to address these Questions    The global span of cryospheric processes and the strong daily to seasonal swing in the  extent of snow and ice makes studying the cryosphere an especially challenging scientific  objective. Seasonal snow varies tremendously as a function of wind, vegetation, and  topography, limiting ability to directly transfer knowledge among study areas, and  underlining the need for global measurements. Moreover the variety of forms in which  ice and snow can be manifest in earth systems means that no single observing system is  capable of making adequate observations.  Rather an ensemble of techniques is required  to fully appreciate and eventually understand the complexities of the cryosphere and its  interaction with other earth systems.    Spaceborne techniques satisfy requirements for spatial extent and, in most cases, the  revisit periods commensurate with cryospheric processes.  While the deep sub-surface  temperature of ice sheets is a quantity that varies only on long time scales, sea ice,  permafrost, and other cryospheric dynamic processes require more frequent observations.  Airborne sensors, deployed for example by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, supplement  with the their flexibility to obtain information about local to regional scale processes and  to deploy aircraft-unique instruments that are more complicated to implement from a  space-based platform.  The low-frequency, multi-channel microwave radiometer system  envisioned here will be soon be tested in situ and from aircraft.  A spaceborne system  will provide the global reach required for ice sheet, sea ice, seasonal snow cover,  permafrost, and research.        3    3.1  Existing, planned and required programs necessary to provide the capabilities  to answer key questions.       NASA’s successful deployment of SMAP and the planned deployments of ICESat-2 and  GRACE Follow-on are necessary capabilities for continuing several of the key  cryospheric records discussed above.  In addition, interferometric synthetic aperture radar  measurements are in progress or are planned by the international community and these  should be taken advantage of in the fashion of past successful collaborations [5].  As  suggested above, a critical gap in this observing suite is the measurement of subsurface  temperatures and other physical properties at depth.  The new concept of low-frequency  (few hundred MHz to several GHz) multi-channel microwave radiometry offers a way  forward. Such systems can be configured also to achieve fine spectral resolution (100  MHz or better) as a ‘hyperspectral’ radiometer for specific applications.  Surface  deployment of such a prototype is now underway with an aircraft campaign slated for  2016.  While there are major challenges for a space-based system, recent work on  instrument design and on RFI mitigation suggest that a satellite instrument can be  conceived and operated successfully. The configuration of frequency channels and  operating modes for a space-based system can be optimized to tradeoff science  requirements versus the number of channels and instrument size.     3.2   Linking space-based observations with other observations.    Understanding and reacting to the evolving behavior of glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice,  permafrost and seasonal snow requires combinations of observations - some of which can  be obtained from space and some which can only be obtained from aircraft or in situ  campaigns.  For example, globally extensive, spaceborne measurements of ice-surface  elevation are complemented by airborne UHF radar measurements of snow and ice  thickness.  As suggested above, the concept described here will provide new information  on subsurface temperature and structure.  For example, fine-spectral resolution  measurements in the UHF portion of the spectrum may be able to be used to infer  information on the vertical stratigraphy of the seasonal snow pack. Preliminary studies  have shown that temporal autocorrelation in such measurements should carry information  on vertical stratigraphy of seasonal snowpacks, including its overall depth [6]. Such  information would be vital to water managers, weather forecasters, and the science  community as a whole, particularly when augmented and/or combined with other sources  of information on snow properties. The passive microwave aspect of the proposed system  also complements other mission proposals for snow sensing based on the use of dual- frequency SAR systems.  Passive microwave measurements provide – albeit at coarser  spatial resolution – sensitivity to temperature information and potentially to snow  composition that is not available from SAR systems, and at much lower cost and  complexity.    4.0  Anticipated scientific and societal benefits     NASA’s continued commitment to cryospheric observations is essential for better  predicting the future of Earth’s ice and snow climes.

Climate change is expected to substantially alter the Earth’s water cycle1, impacting society and ecosystems globally2. The ocean component dominates the global water cycle, comprising nearly 97% of the Earth’s water and with over 75% (85%) of the annual global precipitation (evaporation) occurring over the ocean3-7. While the society critically depends on the terrestrial elements of the water cycle, those elements are fundamentally linked to the ocean through atmospheric moisture transport and continental runoff 8-10. A coordinated observational program of the global water cycle, centered on the dominant oceanic branch, is therefore necessary to address the following key challenges in Earth System Science that are relevant to a broad spectrum of basic and applied research as well as applications and operations:  How is the water cycle changing? Changes in the global water cycle can be detected by monitoring the fluxes of water among the oceanic, terrestrial, and cryospheric components of the Earth system, as well as the water storage within each of them. There are substantial challenges associated with each of these measurements11-13. For example, while satellites can provide global measurements of precipitation, little direct measurements are available for oceanic evaporation. The latter must be estimated empirically from measurements of wind speed, air and sea surface temperature, and humidity and is subject to considerable uncertainty. The ocean-atmosphere net water flux, evaporation-precipitation (E-P), is the difference between two large uncertain quantities (E and P). Substantial discrepancies exist among E-P products12,14. Responding to E-P instead of E and P separately and by integrating over the intermittent E-P changes, salinity acts as a sentinel for basin to global E-P changes4,15. It also reflects the export (import) of water and latent heat energy from (into) a region. In particular, the subtropical highs and underlying salinity maximum regions serve as the sources of the global water cycle, exporting fresh water to high latitudes, the tropics and land16.  Deciphering climate change effects on terrestrial elements of the water cycle (e.g., total continental runoff) has been complicated by human activities (e.g., dams and agriculture). Land-based precipitation records, although spanning over a century, are spatially too heterogeneous to provide continental or global view, and are extremely sparse in the tropics and mid-latitudes over many continents11,13. Despite inconclusive evidence for trends in total continental runoff 17,18, ocean salinity measurements have shown significant trends15,19-26. In the past five decades, the large-scale salinity contrast has strengthened24 (“salty gets saltier and fresh gets fresher”). This is the strongest available evidence for an intensification of the global water cycle2 (“wet gets wetter and dry gets drier”). Climate models forced by increasing greenhouse gasses also project such enhancement of salinity contrast27-29 and the rate of salinity pattern intensification is linearly related to both the rate of the water cycle increase and the global surface warming rate28. Increasing evidence closely links flood and drought cycles and extremes to variations in the oceanic water cycle across various time scales13,30.  How does the change in the ocean element of the water cycle influence ocean circulation and climate? Salinity and temperature determine seawater density and have been identified by WMO as essential climate variables (https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/index.php?name=EssentialClimateVariables). Together they influence ocean circulation and the ventilation of the ocean interior. Changes in global sea surface salinity (SSS) distributions, influenced by changes in the water cycle, enhance or inhibit the subduction of water masses and the sequestration of heat, anthropogenic carbon, and other gases to the subsurface ocean31. Ocean circulation mediates the forcing by E-P, river runoff, and ice-melt and redistributes freshwater geographically32. At high-latitudes, salinity changes associated with melting sea ice and ice sheet/shelf have significant implications to ocean thermohaline circulation and related heat transport33. In the tropics, salinity mediates air/sea coupling34,35 and influences ENSO dynamics and forecast skills36-39. Oceanic water cycle and salinity are also important to sea level changes40,41. Oceanic latent heat release due to evaporation affects the global energy balance42. How are marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle influenced by a changing water cycle?  Marine ecosystem and ocean carbon cycle strongly depend on ocean circulation43, which is influenced by salinity and water cycle changes. In addition, oceanic total alkalinity, an important parameter for carbon cycle and ocean acidification studies, correlates strongly with salinity44,45. Hence, marine ecosystem and carbon cycle research and applications need a good knowledge of ocean salinity.  Significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the above challenges. Given the increasing evidence for an intensification of the water cycle (references in section 1), it is imperative to fill these knowledge gaps in the next decade and beyond. In particular, it is vital to sustain and enhance ocean salinity measurements to detect continuing trends, to shed light on water cycle changes, to examine the relative contributions from climate change and natural decadal variability, to investigate the consequences for ocean circulation and the potential feedbacks to the climate system, and to assess the impacts on marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Major advances have been made in the past decade in observing salinity through in-situ and satellite technologies. There are currently over 3700 autonomous Argo profiling floats sampling the upper 2000 m of much of the open ocean. Recent satellite missions have demonstrated the capability to map global SSS with much finer and more uniform sampling. These include NASA’s Aquarius mission (August 2011-June 2015) and ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission (2009-present).  Significant advances in ocean state estimation have enabled synthesis of ocean observations with state-of-the-art ocean general circulation models46 to estimate E-P constrained by ocean observations and dynamics47,48. The fidelity of climate models has improved in parallel2. These models are useful for examining the sensitivity of the water cycle to climate change and the links between the oceanic and terrestrial elements of the water cycle. However, their further improvement in the next decade hinges on the continuity and enhancement of observations of the oceanic water cycle that are needed to adequately validate the models. These complementary developments in satellite and in-situ ocean observing systems, ocean state estimation, and climate models have put researchers in a strong position to address the above challenges in the coming decade.  Addressing the above challenges requires global SSS measurements with spatial and temporal resolutions that resolve the energetic mesoscale ocean variability (tens to hundreds of km, days to months). To avoid grounding, very few Argo floats were deployed in coastal oceans and marginal seas that are important links to regional or basin wide water cycle. Argo also has limited coverage in high-latitude oceans, where strong links to the cryosphere component of the water cycle (e.g., sea ice and ice shelf/sheet) exist. Moreover, Argo can capture variability larger than several hundred km and on monthly and longer time scales, but is insufficient to resolve mesoscale variations that are important to ocean dynamics, air-sea interaction, and marine biology49-51. Therefore, space-based SSS observations are fundamental for addressing the above challenges. Satellite SSS and other space-based observations are providing new insights in biogeochemistry52-56.  NASA’s Aquarius mission dedicated to SSS measurements was lost in June 2015. ESA’s SMOS mission continues to provide SSS measurements. SSS retrievals from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, which has a similar L-band active (radar)-passive (radiometer) design to Aquarius, are under development. SMAP’s radar would have provided measurements to correct surface roughness effect on SSS retrievals. Unfortunately, the radar stopped functioning in July 2015. The L-band radiometers of these missions have poor salinity sensitivity at low water temperatures (high-latitude oceans) and limited ability to detect the thickness of salinity-influencing sea ice. In high-latitude oceans, salinity is the dominant factor determining water density and has a major influence on thermohaline ocean circulation. Therefore, it is imperative for future satellite missions to improve the accuracy of SSS measurements at high-latitudes and the capability to monitor sea ice thickness. ESA is coordinating exploratory studies to address the continuity of L-band SSS and soil moisture measurements. It is important for the US to invest and coordinate with the international community to continue space-borne SSS measurements, especially for enhancing the capability to capture mesoscale ocean variability and to monitor coastal regions, marginal seas, and high-latitude oceans.   Synergistic use with other satellite measurements further enhances the value of satellite SSS measurements. Combining SSS, soil moisture, gravity, sea level, precipitation, and atmospheric water vapor measurements facilitates studying the links of oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial elements of the water cycle. SSS and cryospheric measurements (e.g., sea ice, ice shelf/sheet) can be used together to study ocean-cryosphere interaction, which is essential for understanding sea level rise. For the ocean, SSS and surface temperature measurements together enable space-based determination of sea surface density for the study of water mass formation processes. SSS together with ocean surface current estimates derived altimetry and scatterometry and with in-situ Argo measurements allow the investigation of salinity and freshwater budgets in the ocean mixed layer. Ocean state estimation using these data as constraints makes possible the estimation of oceanic freshwater transport and E-P across the air-sea interface.   Addressing the above challenges will improve the understanding of the changing global water cycle and the links among its elements. This has significant implications to water and food supply, health, and power supply.  It will also improve the understanding of related feedbacks to the climate through ocean-atmosphere interaction. Change in latent heat release from the ocean due to evaporation affects global energy balance, which is important to climate change. Monitoring SSS changes related to the water cycle will benefit research and applications of marine ecosystems and carbon cycle. Enhanced understanding of the linkages of the water cycle with the ocean, climate, marine ecosystems, and carbon cycle will lead to better predictions and projections that benefit the human society through improved policies, decisions, mitigation, and adaptation regarding floods and droughts, agriculture, and fisheries.  The challenges involve broad communities across various disciplines including oceanography, land hydrology, cryosphere, atmosphere, climate, and biogeochemistry.   References: 1.

The Global Positioning System  (GPS) satellites have become primary sensors to measure signatures associated with such  natural hazards. These signatures typically include GPS-derived seismic deformation  measurements, co-seismic vertical displacements, and real-time GPS-derived ocean buoy  positioning estimates. Another way to use GPS observables is to compute the ionospheric  total electron content (TEC) to measure and monitor post-seismic ionospheric  disturbances caused by earthquakes, volcano eruptions, and tsunamis.    Earthquakes are known to generate electron density irregularities in the ionosphere and  TEC variations through atmospheric acoustic waves. There are three types of atmospheric  waves typically generated by earthquakes: (1) direct acoustic waves generated near the  epicenter; (2) gravity waves generated by a tsunami; (3) secondary acoustic waves  excited by the Rayleigh surface wave outside the epicenter area. GPS measurements are  well suited to monitor ionospheric activities associated with earthquakes both in the  epicenter area (i.e., using dense local GPS networks) and outside of it (i.e., using global  GPS networks) with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to infer key properties such  as velocity, direction, and magnitude of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs).     Volcanic eruptions also generate TEC perturbations triggered by acoustic and gravity  waves. At ionospheric heights, coupling between neutral particles and free electrons  induces electron density fluctuations. TEC fluctuations have been used to estimate  explosive energy of a volcanic eruption. Although indirect, using TEC perturbations is  becoming increasingly important because of the lack of other reliable means to measure  energy content.    Tsunamis have been observed to generate traveling ionospheric disturbances due to  internal gravity waves.  Such TIDs are distinguishable from TIDs caused by other sources  (such as geomagnetic activity or tropospheric weather) by the fact that tsunami-driven  TIDs match the period, velocity, and propagation direction of the ocean tsunamis causing  them.   Key Challenges:   The key challenges the community faces will be to elucidate the mechanics of  tsunamigenic earthquakes through a combination of ground-based GNSS receivers and  spaceborne assets. This knowledge will aid both the assessment and mitigation of natural  hazards and the response to extreme events. The research community will be challenged        2     to quantify the coupling between earthquakes, tsunamis, and tsunami-generated  ionospheric TEC perturbations. The ionosphere-based measurements of natural hazards  such as earthquakes and tsunamis are surprisingly useful because 1) surface, acoustic, and  gravity wave propagation in the upper atmosphere is well-understood using first- principle-based physics models, 2) they may be observed before tsunami arrival at  coastlines due to low-elevation measurements and 3) they provide dense measurements  of the tsunami signature as opposed to isolated data points from buoys or tsunameters.  The combination of ground-based and spaceborne measurements will allow scientists to  characterize earthquake-tsunami coupling processes and better understand tsunami  generation or their earthquake sources. Furthermore, researchers will need to map the  spatial extent of both the earthquake and the tsunami-induced TIDs in 3-dimensions by  relying on the ionosphere as a common medium.   Determining earthquake moment magnitudes (Mw) using ground-based measurements  leads to large uncertainties. Due to the complexities of interpreting seismometer  measurements and epistemic uncertainties in critical parameters such as Earth structure,  the uncertainties in Mw may persist for months and years after the events, such as Mw  8.8 to 9.2 estimates for the Tohoku-Oki event, Mw 8.3 ± 3.3 for the 1964 Alaska  earthquake. Tsunamis are predominantly generated by earthquakes. Earthquake-induced  landslides and volcanic eruptions are other sources of tsunamis. Seismic data have been  the primary measurements for tsunami studies. For earthquake-generated tsunamis, the  earthquake magnitude is related to the tsunami energy but the relationship is not yet well  understood.    Timeliness:   Many fatalities occur when small earthquakes followed by larger tsunamis go undetected.  Accuracy in determination of the tsunami scale – a quantitative representation of the  tsunami potential destructive force – is critical. It serves as a threshold for issuing a  tsunami warning to affected areas. Earthquake source modeling can be improved using  joint inversions of land-based estimates of co-seismic deformation from GPS, near-shore  wave gauges, along with novel GPS ionosphere-derived tsunami measurements. The  expected results include better earthquake source estimation, initialization of tsunami  propagation in near-source coastline, and improvement in inundation forecasts by a factor  of 2 as the increase in earthquake magnitude is proportional to the square of the  propagation speed. Understanding the relationship of seismic waves to tsunami  generation is critical and timely to developing future systems capable of increasing  warning time and reducing fatalities as well as material damage.   Why space?   To help decrease the uncertainties in estimating earthquake moment the community will  need to leverage the experience with ground-based GPS ionospheric TEC measurements  that was gained over the years. The researchers will need to demonstrate that tsunami  wave amplitudes and propagation speeds observed by TID measurements can be inverted  using a physics-based model. For better understanding of earthquake to tsunami energy  transfer and its source, and to increase the spatial and temporal coverage over the oceans,  a successful inversion will require the use of spaceborne measurements. To take        3     advantage of the growing number of low Earth orbiters (LEOs) including the current  Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC)  and upcoming COSMIC-2 constellations and additional NASA remote sensing spacecraft,  the community will need to process and analyze the ionospheric radio occultation  measurements and spaceborne airglow measurements for investigating earthquake- and  tsunami-generated TEC perturbations.   Increasing the temporal and spatial coverage over the oceans using the combination of  ground-based GPS and spaceborne ionospheric measurements will help quantify our  understanding of the relationship between earthquakes and the subsequent tsunamis.  Combining ground-based and spaceborne measurements will make it possible to quantify  energies for smaller and therefore more frequent events. Such capability is imperative to  understand and quantify the wave coupling of earthquakes and tsunamis to the ionosphere.  Researchers will gain a better understanding of errors affecting the tsunami wave heights  and vertical surface displacements that have direct impact on the coupling mechanism to  the ionosphere.   Responses to the Questions:   a. Is there a capability gap?    Scientists have recently come to the understanding that seismic data alone are unable to  provide the level of accuracy required for tsunami modeling and energy transfer estimates.  Other ground-based techniques exist to estimate tsunami energy including the use of  coastal GPS data and tsunameters. Atmospheric and ionospheric disturbances are  promptly generated by earthquakes and tsunamis and contain important geophysical  signals on earthquake-tsunami coupling. However, there exists no other measurement  system that is capable of substantially contributing to simultaneously estimating both  seismic radiation energy and tsunami energy using spaceborne measurements. The  combination of ground-based and spaceborne measurements provides a unique  opportunity to study the spatial extent of seismic events while reducing systematic errors  in simultaneously estimated seismic and tsunami energies. Other ground-based  measurement techniques either contribute to estimating seismic or tsunami energies but  not both.    b. Linking space-based observations with other observations;   Researchers must increase the spatial and temporal measurement coverage over e.g., the  Pacific region to investigate coupling between earthquake- and tsunami-generated  ionospheric signatures. Up to date no researchers have attempted to use both ground- based and spaceborne measurements to establish a link between acoustic and gravity- wave-generated TEC perturbations associated with the same earthquake and tsunami  events.   c. Scientific and Societal Benefits   Earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes are among the most disrupting forces faced by  humankind, often endangering heavily populated coastal areas. The tsunami of March 11,  2011 in Japan caused over 10,000 fatalities. The Chilean tsunami of February 27, 2010        4     and the Samoa tsunami of Sep 29, 2009 caused hundreds of deaths, and the Sumatra  tsunami of 2004 took the largest toll of human life on record, with approximately 228,000  casualties attributed to the waves.  These tsunamis had a major impact on public  consciousness as they made their way across the oceans, affecting distant islands and  coasts up to 24 hours after the earthquake.  To better prepare society for the consequences  of multiple natural hazards, it is our responsibility to help develop early warning systems  for which researchers are expected to provide invaluable contributions over the next  decade.   d. The science communities that would be involved   Exploring new measurements techniques will be paramount to monitor extreme events,  including storms, heat waves, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This will represent a  major improvement to the current state of knowledge, and one that can be potentially  applied to early warning systems in the case of tsunamis, volcanoes, explosions, and  other events. Furthermore, the increased temporal and spatial coverage provided to users  using spaceborne measurements will be expected to enable scientists in the natural  hazards area to estimate the size of inundation, tsunami run-ups and storm surges.

Wielicki NASA Langley Research Center 1.0 Introduction It is widely recognized that climate change is a defining issue of this century. Accordingly, a key objective of NASA’s Science Plan for the Science Mission Directorate is to improve the understanding and prediction of climate. Fundamentally, climate change involves a perturbation to Earth’s energy budget, which in turn impacts Earth’s water cycle. Changes in the composition of the atmosphere either through natural or anthropogenic sources alter how energy is distributed within the Earth’s system and can lead to irreversible changes in regional climate. Because climate is a global problem, satellites play a key role in climate research. At the TOA the energy budget involves a balance between how much solar energy Earth absorbs and how much terrestrial thermal infrared radiation is emitted to space. NASA’s long history in observing the TOA ERB is acknowledged in the 2007 and 2013 reports of the IPCC (IPCC 2007, 2013), the 2007 NRC Decadal Survey (NRC 2007), and the GCOS implementation plan of the WMO (GCOS 2004). A key reason for NASA’s success in this area is due to its support of the CERES Project and its predecessor, ERBE. These projects have provided vital data for climate model evaluation and improvement over the past 3 decades. At the surface, the energy budget involves a balance between net radiation, sensible and latent heat, and heat storage, primarily in the ocean. On average, the radiation heats the surface and cools the atmosphere, which is balanced by the hydrological cycle and sensible heating. Regional variations in the energy budget such as the equator-to-pole gradient give rise to the general circulation of the atmosphere and oceans.   Here we briefly discuss some of the key challenges and questions related to Earth’s energy and water cycles with a focus on the observations needed to support research in these areas. 2. Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) Approximately 30% of the incident solar radiation reaching Earth is scattered back to space by clouds, the Earth’s surface, and aerosols. The remaining 70% is absorbed by the surface-atmosphere system, providing the energy necessary to sustain life on Earth. The ASR is converted into different forms of energy (e.g., potential, internal, latent, and kinetic energy), and transported and stored throughout the system. In order to maintain a relatively stable temperature, the Earth also emits thermal infrared radiation to space as OLR. In an equilibrium climate, there is a global balance between ASR and OLR. When the climate system is forced by natural or anthropogenic factors, an imbalance in the TOA ERB results. Climate forcings that impact EEI include changes in the solar output, large volcanic eruptions, and human activities. Combined CERES and oceanic measurements indicate that there is a positive energy imbalance in which ASR exceeds OLR by 0.6 Wm-2 during the first decade of the 21st century (Loeb et al., 2012). Approximately 93% of the excess energy is stored in the ocean. A positive EEI is associated with global temperature rise, sea-level rise and an acceleration of the hydrological cycle. EEI is thus a fundamental metric of global climate change that is in many ways a more useful quantity than global surface temperature as it provides a measure of the net climate forcing acting on Earth (Hansen et al., 2005). Monitoring how EEI changes with time and understanding what is driving the changes are critically important climate problems. Owing to internal variations in the climate system, EEI needs to be observed over a wide range of time and space scales as internal variations can mask a longer-term climate signal. Currently, the best strategy to observe EEI involves synergistic use of satellite TOA radiation observations and recently improved ocean heat content measurements. In-situ ocean measurements provide the magnitude of EEI, but require 5 or more years to reduce uncertainties to a few tenths of 1 Wm-2 due to sampling uncertainties. Conversely, satellite measurements provide global coverage daily and are highly stable radiometrically, but cannot provide an absolute measure of the EEI to the required accuracy level, as the observed ASR and OLR are well over two orders of magnitude larger than the EEI. The solution is to anchor the satellite-based EEI to that obtained from in-situ ocean heating rate measurements acquired over at least a 5-year period of well-sampled in-situ measurements, accounting also for smaller contributions from ocean heat storage in the deep ocean, ice warming and melt, and atmospheric and lithospheric warming. Loeb et al. (2012) use this approach with CERES observations and in-situ Argo measurements acquired after 2005 to track monthly changes in EEI during the CERES period. A key challenge is to maintain the measurement systems to accurately monitor EEI over multiple decades. The CERES observations began in 2000 with the Terra launch, which was followed by Aqua and S-NPP launches in 2002 and 2011, respectively. There is also a CERES instrument that will launch on JPSS-1 in 2016, and a follow-on ERB instrument called RBI to be launched on JPSS-2 in 2021. In order to ensure the EEI record extends to the late 2020s and beyond requires that multiple copies of RBI be built and preferably flown on satellites that also carry an imager instrument with capabilities comparable to or better than those of MODIS or VIIRS. The CERES processing system combines CERES with imager data to improve the accuracy of the TOA fluxes, to enable improved attribution of what causes changes in the TOA ERB, and to estimate radiative fluxes at the surface. 3. Closing the Surface Energy Budget with Observations Using the best observational estimates of surface radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes, there remains a 15 Wm-2 bias in the global surface energy budget. This represents approximately 20% of the global mean precipitation rate when converted into latent heating. Regionally, the imbalance is most pronounced in the tropics over regions of convection (e.g., west tropical Pacific Ocean, ITCZ, SPCZ) (Loeb et al., 2014). The bias falls outside of the envelope of observational uncertainty when the stated errors in the individual datasets are combined (Kato et al., 2015). The observations include satellite precipitation (GPCP, TRMM, GPM), satellite-derived surface radiative fluxes, including a combination of many different instruments (CERES, MODIS/VIIRS, geostationary VIS/IR imagers, CALIPSO/Cloudsat), satellite and/or reanalysis-based surface latent heat fluxes, reanalysis-based sensible heat fluxes, and satellite TOA fluxes (CERES) to constrain atmosphere heating/cooling and SW surface fluxes. Some of the limitations in the observations include: precipitation algorithm dependence on rainfall drop size distribution; precipitation accuracy for drizzle, snowfall and heavy precipitation; a lack of reliable ground truth precipitation data over ocean; uncertainties in the input data stream used to compute surface radiative fluxes (reanalysis-based temperature/humidity profiles and skin temperatures, imager-based cloud and aerosol retrievals; surface albedo); and a lack of high-accuracy surface radiation measurements over open ocean and polar regions for quantifying errors in satellite surface fluxes.  In the near-term, there is a need for studies of the observational requirements to verify GPM drop size distribution assumptions to achieve stable probability distributions as a function of precipitation type/meteorological state.  Studies are also needed to assess the utility and sampling requirements of long duration polar flights of ER-2 with multifrequency Doppler radar observations to estimate polar precipitation, drizzle, and snow.  These studies might be accomplished with large domain Cloud Resolving Model runs with multi-moment cloud and rainfall size distributions. Studies of the long-term average (monthly and annual) accuracies of BSRN and ocean buoy surface radiative fluxes are also needed.  4. Changes over the Arctic While the marked decline in sea ice and increased warming over the Arctic in recent decades are well documented, the underlying processes are poorly understood owing to a lack of reliable observations. There remains substantial uncertainty about whether clouds are reducing or increasing the rapid warming in the Arctic, especially during autumn and winter. The surface energy budget is poorly constrained, particularly in the thermal infrared owing to unreliable near-surface temperature/humidity data. The region is also challenging because it is influenced by pronounced internal variability, which means a long observational record is needed in order to provide robust conclusions from the data. This poses a major remote sensing challenge, as the longest available satellite records providing cloud information are from visible/infrared imagers, which are less reliable at high latitudes. Furthermore, due to the lack of reliable measurements and poor model representation, there is substantial uncertainty in temperature/humidity profiles from reanalyses. Nevertheless, the rapid reduction of sea ice extent is changing the radiation environment so rapidly that CERES TOA SW and LW flux trends are statistically significant after only 12 years of observations (Hartmann and Ceppi, 2014).  In the near-term, there is a need to further exploit current observations from the A-train and prepare for the upcoming EarthCARE mission, which will provide new active satellite measurements. Field experiments are essential for providing focused cloud, surface, and temperature/humidity and radiative flux measurements to help improve satellite-derived surface fluxes and cloud retrievals. Longer term, there is a critical need to plan for continued active sensors beyond the EarthCARE mission.

Key Science and Application Challenges Wetland dynamics is crucial to changes in both atmospheric methane and terrestrial water storage, which are directly relevant to global water and energy cycle sciences.  The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) highlights the role of wetlands as a key driver of methane (CH4) emission, which is more than one order of magnitude stronger than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas in the centennial time scale.   In the multitude of methane emission sources (hydrates, livestock, rice cultivation, freshwaters, landfills and waste, fossil fuels, biomass burning, termites, geological sources, and oxidations in soils), wetlands constitute the largest contributor with the widest uncertainty range of 177-284 Tg(CH4) yr–1 according to the IPCC estimate [IPCC, 2013]. In the global water and energy cycles, it is critical to identify and understand interrelations of hydrological cycles involving precipitations, soil moisture change, inundation, stream flow and runoff with wetlands dynamics and cycles of CH4 emission change.  Pertaining to CH4 production and emission is the anaerobic metabolism for which inundated wetlands are directly relevant. As such there is a close connectivity in water and methane cycles. As the water cycle accelerates and intensifies in a changing climate [Syed et al., 2010; Durack et al., 2012], impacts on wetlands and thus CH4 emission are expected, but quantitative assessments require quantitative characterization of wetland dynamics at various time scales (seasonal, annual, interannual, to decadal scales). Wetlands are highly susceptible to climate change that might lead to wetland collapse. Such wetland destruction would decrease the terrestrial water storage capacity and thus contribute to sea level rise, consequently exacerbating coastal flooding problems.  For both CH4 change and water storage change, wetland dynamics is a crucial factor with the largest uncertainty.    The increase or decrease in wetland extent is dependent on the regional wetland hydrology that can be significantly impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation.  Consequently, the complex changes inflict a low confidence in quantitative projections of wetland CH4 emission from models and ecosystem warming experiments. And yet, both spatial distribution and temporal variability of wetlands remain highly unconstrained despite the existence of remote sensing products [Papa et al., 2010; IPCC, 2013].  This wetland information gap has long been recognized in the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme Global Analysis, Integration and Modelling (IGBP-GAIM) report, stating “Wetland extent: The largest gap in wetland characterization is the size of wetlands themselves, both in space and time. The level of flooding and the areal extent of wetlands is the largest uncertainty in applying models of wetland function to models of the global system. Both the temporal and areal extent of wetland flooding should be characterized in terms of ha-days. An additional factor is the phasing of flooding (i.e., continuous or intermittent). These issues are not adequately addressed in land cover compilations and terrestrial ecosystem models” [IGBP-GAIM, 1996].   Regarding the importance of wetlands to societal benefits, the Ramsar Convention [2015], an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands, articulates that “wetlands are vital for human survival. They are among the world’s most productive environments; cradles of biological diversity that provide the water and productivity upon which countless species of plants and animals depend for survival. Wetlands are indispensable for the countless benefits or “ecosystem services” that they provide humanity, ranging from freshwater supply, food and building materials, and biodiversity, to flood control, groundwater recharge, and climate change mitigation.” As a key community of practice, the Ramsar Convention provides the single most global framework for intergovernmental cooperation on wetland issues, and a platform for collaboration between governments, experts, international NGOs, local communities and private companies and for promotion of scientific and technical cooperation and exchange of knowledge.  2. Urgency and Timeliness Compounding the difficulties in discerning CH4 change, its growth in the Earth atmosphere has varied peculiarly in recent decades, demanding an urgent and significant advance in wetland monitoring capability to timely capture and understand such changes.  Whereas CH4 concentration was stable for a decade since the late 1990s, CH4 emission has increased again since 2007 after a decade of ‘methane hiatus’ in 1990s-2000s [IPCC, 2013] to closely observe the renewed increase in a timely manner as CH4 emission changes along a new phase, whose cause is yet to be found, and establish whether it is a part of a new decadal cycle or a shift into a new regime of CH4 emission.  While the exact drivers of such renewed growth is still unclear, a bottom-up estimation [IPCC, 2013] suggests that climate-driven fluctuations of methane emissions from natural wetlands are the main drivers of the global interannual variability of CH4 emissions.  While IGBP-GAIM report highlighted the progress made in the 1980s leading to the classic global digital dataset of wetlands [Matthews and Fung, 1987], it also noted the deficiency and insufficiency in wetland characterizations.  Such limitation remains [Papa et al., 2010; IPCC, 2013] as there has been no break-through in global wetland mapping. Moreover, the urgent need of global data to monitor wetlands is emphasized by the rapid rate of wetland loss (~64 % of the world’s wetlands have disappeared since 1900) [Ramsar Fact Sheet 3, 2015].  In parallel, the populations of freshwater species declined by 76% between 1970 and 2010 according to World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Index [WWF, 2015].  These astounding deterioration rates need to be verified, captured, and monitored globally to determine whether such changes decelerate or even accelerate faster. Beyond science research, such wetland information is important to the community of practice (stakeholders, city planners, decision makers, local and state agencies, etc.) for societal benefit applications in an array of ecosystem functions where wetlands must be preserved or restored [LMU, 2015].  Recognizing the urgent need for a complete and consistent map of global wetlands, the Ramsar Convention [2015] calls for a wetlands inventory and impact assessment. 3. Space-Based Observations and Potential Break-Through Space-based observations are fundamentally imperative for global monitoring of wetlands in time and in space routinely over the global coverage, while in-situ data can be collected over small areas for local applications and for validations of satellite algorithms.   The IGBP-GAIM report [IGBP-GAIM, 1996] reviewed and provided a great evaluation of advantages and limitations of various remote-sensing methods for wetland mapping.  These include an array of different instruments systematically grouped into six categories: optical coarse resolution, optical fine resolution, optical/hyperspectral, passive microwave, active microwave, and synthetic aperture radar sensors.  Since the late 1990s, numerous satellite sensors have been launched and/operated, from which datasets have been applied to map wetlands and observe their changes.  A recent method based on polarization-ratio anomalies using satellite data from a Ku-band scanning scatterometer successfully demonstrates that weekly monitoring of wetland can delineate the terrestrial water storage capacity of the Mississippi wetlands in holding and later releasing water into the river system.  Despite of these past methods and recent advances, a consistent global characterization, for both spatial distribution and temporal variability of wetlands, remains deficient [IPCC, 2013].  This demands new break-through methods to advance the capability to monitor global wetland dynamics in synergy with present and future satellite sensors/constellations. The abundance of current and future Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) may offer a potential break-through for wetland dynamic monitoring, which necessitates a demonstration that GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) can distinctively identify wetlands.  Initial results from the Catalonia (Spain) aircraft field campaign and TechDemoSat-1 satellite observations over known wetland areas have indicated the capability of GNSS-R to detect wetlands [Zuffada et al., 2015].  Although limited in lower latitudes, the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System mission will provide much more extensive satellite data for GNSS-R wetland algorithms development and verifications for use with future global GNSS-R measurements. GNSS-R advantages include: (1) Frequent and global coverage from multiple constellations, (2) long-term GNSS transmitters to be continued decades into the far future, (3) low-cost small-size receivers and antennas, (4) low frequencies unaffected by clouds or rains and less obscurity by vegetation cover, and (5) strong coherent forward reflection signatures in the bistatic geometry over inundated wetlands. 4. Wetlands Science, Applications, and Technology Communities The wetlands science community across a wide range of expertise and disciplines, including the IGBP-GAIM, engaged and contributed significantly to the IPCC AR5, which highlights to critical roles on wetlands in methane emissions and water storage in a changing climate [IPCC, 2013]. The Ramsar Convention represents a key community of practice across the world for wetlands science and applications, together with local wetlands authorities and stakeholders. In writing this white paper, key findings from IGBP-GAIM, IPCC AR5, and the Ramsar Convention have been included, and interactions with airborne-satellite technology communities have been involved.  These science and applications communities demand advances in wetlands observations from satellites to fill the critical and urgent gap of knowledge of global wetland dynamics from now to future decades.

We measure and monitor the Earth’s environmental system (its oceans, ice, land, atmosphere)  not only to understand the processes of global change, but to also enable educated decisions on  how to cope with these changes. Space agencies like NASA are heavily investing in satellites to  make these measurements. Many of these depend on a highly accurate and stable terrestrial  reference frame (TRF) within which to interpret the data and understand trends in the processes  of change.     The TRF is the foundation for virtually all space-based, airborne and ground-based Earth  observations. Positions of objects are determined within an underlying TRF and the accuracy  with which objects can be positioned ultimately depends on the accuracy of the TRF. Through its  tie to the celestial reference frame by time-dependent Earth orientation parameters it is also  fundamentally important for interplanetary spacecraft tracking and navigation. The TRF  determined by geodetic measurements is the indispensable foundation for all geo-referenced data  used by science and society. It allows different spatial information, such as imagery from  different space and airborne platforms, to be geo-referenced and aligned with each other. And it  plays a key role in modeling and estimating the motion of the Earth in space, in measuring  change and deformation of all components of the Earth system, and in providing the ability to  connect measurements made at the same place at different times, a critical requirement for  understanding global, regional and local change. Providing an accurate, stable, and maintainable  TRF to support numerous scientific and societal applications is an important goal of the  International Association of Geodesy’s (IAG’s) Global Geodetic Observing System and of  NASA’s contribution to it, the Space Geodesy Project.    The TRF is maintained though a global network of ground sites with co-located SLR, VLBI,  GNSS, and DORIS stations. The most accurate global TRFs currently available are the  International Terrestrial Reference Frames (ITRFs) produced under the auspices of IAG’s  International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service. Requirements for the ITRF have  increased dramatically. Today, the most stringent requirement comes from critical sea level  programs: a global accuracy of 1.0 mm, and 0.1 mm/yr stability. This is a factor of 5-10 beyond  current capability. Future Earth observing satellites will have ever-increasing measurement  capability and should lead to increasingly sophisticated models of the Earth system. The  accuracy and stability of the TRF need to dramatically improve in order to fully realize the  measurement potential of current and future Earth observing satellites.          Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?    The National Research Council issued two seminal reports in recent years (2007 and 2010,  respectively):       • “Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the  Next Decade and Beyond”     • “Precise Geodetic Infrastructure: National Requirements for a Shared   Resource”    The first report, known as the “Decadal, Survey”, was the NRC response to the requests of  NASA and other agencies to generate a consensus of recommendations from the Earth and  environmental science and applications communities regarding: (1) high-priority flight missions  and activities to support national needs for research and monitoring of the dynamic Earth system  during the next decade, and (2) important directions that should influence planning for the  decade beyond. The NRC recommended that:     “The U.S. government, working in concert with the private sector, academe, the  public, and its international partners, should renew its investment in Earth- observing systems and restore its leadership in Earth science and applications.”      The NRC then recommended that a number of critical Earth observing missions take place over  the next decade. These missions have a common denominator in the need for an accurate and  stable International Terrestrial Reference Frame that enables the precise location of the  spacecraft and their scientific instruments. This, in turn, allows the unambiguous referencing of  all scientific data from plate-tectonic displacements to sea-surface height, establishing a key link  between the geodetic infrastructure and the space missions.    The second cited report from the NRC addressed the precarious state of the critical national  geodetic infrastructure, and recommended that:      “The United States, to maintain leadership in industry and science, and as a  matter of national security, should invest in maintaining and improving the  geodetic infrastructure, through upgrades in network design and construction,  modernization of current observing systems, deployment of improved multi- technique observing capabilities, and funding opportunities for research,  analysis, and education in global geodesy.”      In its present form, the geodetic observing system infrastructure is quickly deteriorating, and  products such as an accurate and stable ITRF are in jeopardy. This deterioration is impeding  current infrastructure from being able to meet the new, more stringent science requirements  needed to support the key scientific questions connected to societal challenges.           Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   In   response   to   the   recommendations   of   the   NRC   Report   on   Precise   Geodetic   Infrastructure,   NASA   launched   in   2011   a   major   effort   to   upgrade   the   ground-­‐based   geodetic   infrastructure.       Under the NASA Space Geodesy Project, a pioneering next-generation, geodetic observation  system is taking shape. Activities include engineering and fieldwork relating to the realization of  the first prototype fundamental geodetic site that employs the next-generation of VLBI, SLR,  GNSS and DORIS instruments. Simulations indicate that a well-distributed, global network of  about 32 such next generation sites co-locating all four space-geodetic observing techniques is  needed in order to meet the target requirement on the TRF of 1.0 mm accuracy and 0.1 mm/yr  stability. However, connecting the independent VLBI, SLR, GNSS, and DORIS networks  together to form the ITRF is an ongoing challenge. Ground survey measurements can determine  the distance between the reference markers of the different space-geodetic observing instruments  that are co-located at the same site, but not between the phase centers of the instruments.  Additional measurements and analyses are required to determine the offset of the phase center  from the reference marker of each instrument. While the Space Geodesy Project has plans to  determine the distance between the reference markers of the instruments, there is no plan to  determine the offsets between the reference markers and the phase centers. Establishing and  maintaining the ties between the observing instruments is a major weakness in current  determinations of the ITRF.    An alternative to connecting the observing techniques on the ground is to connect them in space  by co-locating all four techniques on the same dedicated satellite. This approach overcomes  many of the technical limitations of measuring and maintaining precise ground co-locations,  such as variable environment, and the complexity of modeling the ground antennas. Moreover, it  obviates the need for proximate ground co-location of all the geodetic techniques. One approach  to doing this is that of the Geodetic Reference Antenna in SPace (GRASP) mission concept.  GRASP is envisioned to be a compact, stable platform with no moving parts on which all four  space-geodetic observing techniques are co-located. The spacecraft is small enough that the  entire spacecraft, including all instruments, can be placed into an anechoic chamber in order to  measure the distance between the phase centers of the instruments before launch. Simulations  have shown that the target requirement on the TRF can be met after flying GRASP for just three  years. Space-based observations like those envisioned from GRASP are needed in order to  improve the ITRF to its target accuracy in a reasonable amount of time.

Jarnot* *Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology †NorthWest Research Associates and New Mexico Tech  Question 1: What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or  operations in the coming decade?  Points 1(c)and  (d)  Anthropogenic in uences on atmospheric composition are the main drivers of global change 2 and have major impacts on human and ecosystem health.3 Links between composition and physical climate, as seen, for example, in the relationships between stratospheric ozone depletion/recovery, subtropical precipitation, ocean salinity, and polar ice cover4–6 further demonstrate the broad impact of atmospheric composition on the Earth system. Beyond basic research, atmospheric compo- sition and air quality are vitally important for the human and ecosystem health applications communities. One of the foremost challenges in Earth System Science is  the need to improve predictive capability for atmospheric com- position on both the decadal timescale associated with climate forcings and feedbacks and the weekly timescale required for accurate air quality forecasts. Prominent among the impedi- ments to meeting this challenge is the fact that state-of-the-art models at all scales still poorly represent key processes con- trolling water vapor, composition, and clouds in the upper tro- posphere and lower stratosphere 7–9 (UT/LS), where the radia- tive impact of water vapor (the strongest greenhouse gas) and ozone is greatest.10,11 Rapid loing of near-surface air by deep convection strongly in uences the UT/LS, and the fast winds and long chemical lifetimes characterizing this region promote global pollution transport. In addition, the stratosphere, which is inextricably linked to surface climate,12,13 continues to un- dergo severe ozone destruction induced by unnaturally large abundances of chlorine.4,14 Furthermore, long-term trends and substantial but poorly understood variability 15 in strato- spheric water vapor strongly in uence surface climate 16,17 and the ozone layer.4 e atmospheric composition community has identi�ed  critical questions 18–20 whose resolution is essential for improv- ing our predictive capability, including: • How will UT/LS water vapor and ozone and associated chemical processes evolve in a climatewith increased green- house gases (GHGs) and changing ozone depleting sub- stances (ODSs)?  • Given their strong radiative impact, how will changes in UT/LS water vapor and ozone feed back on climate?  • How do deep convection and cirrus clouds interact with upper tropospheric water vapor?  • To what degree is the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC) accelerating, and what are the implications of this change?  • What are the relative roles of various stratosphere tropo- sphere exchange (STE) mechanisms (e.g., deep convection, monsoon circulations, intrusion events) in establishing stratospheric and tropospheric composition and air qual- ity? How will those roles change in an evolving climate?  • How is tropospheric ozone changing globally and region- ally, and what drives that variability on all timescales (emis- sions, chemical processing, convective loing, long-range horizontal transport, STE)?  Question 2: Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now, especially with respect to readiness?  Resolution of the key questions outlined above is particularly timely given that the coming decade will be a pivotal period for the upper troposphere and stratosphere (UT/S), with signs of ozone layer recovery in response to declining ODSs ex- pected to emerge in some regions,4 concurrent with ongoing increases in GHGs. Although the past record of composition measurements has proven invaluable for addressingmajor soci- etal issues (e.g., stratospheric ozone destruction), an extended data record, including improved precision/resolution and addi- tional species, is required for further progress in advancing the state of the art in model realism; 18 indeed, an impending lack of relevant measurements (see below) represents the greatest obstacle to our readiness to move the science forward. Recent studies have exploited available multi-sensor multi-year UT/S records for attribution of changes in Earth system variables,21 underscoring the value of extended long-term global measure- ments. A framework such as that recently recommended by the National Academies 22 can be used to establish the optimal balance between “continuity” and new measurements. In ad- dition, interest is growing in “geoengineering” approaches to tackling climate change,23 including injection of aerosols into the stratosphere, any serious consideration of which demands comprehensive understanding of the UT/S and its sensitivities. e processes a�ecting atmospheric composition take  place in di�erent domains (boundary layer, mid troposphere, upper troposphere, stratosphere), and no single measurement technique is capable of probing them all. Research needs in tropospheric composition over the next ten years can be met in part by planned nadir-viewing sensors (in both low-earth and geostationary orbits) that will or could provide uninter- rupted measurements of tropospheric composition.

For Suomi-NPP, one year of overlap with JPSS-2 is assumed (as JPSS-1 has no OMPS-LP). SAGE-III ISS life is set by ISS extended operations (2020 – 2028, subject to negotiation). Other end dates assume a maximum 25-year mission (in compliance with international agreements on space debris). Right: Typical 5-day coverage for limb emission sounding (upper) and solar occultation (lower).  ion white papers 24 lay out the case for new programmatic opportunities to exploit or develop tropospheric composition products from existing and known future instruments, and also identify measurement priorities that will remain unmet.  Point(a)  In contrast, prospects for future measurements with the vertical resolution necessary to capture the strong gradients in the UT/S are meager. Suitable instruments fall into two broad categories: limb emission/scattering sounders with daily near- global coverage, and solar/lunar/stellar occultation sounders with sparser spatial coverage but typically better precision and vertical resolution. Figure 1 summarizes the capabilities of rel- evant current and planned instruments, illustrating the antici- pated dramatic decrease in measurement assets in the coming decade. e looming cessation of such observations has been emphasized in international assessments,25 and is expected to be heavily stressed in the GCOS 26 Status of the Global Observ- ing System for Climate report 27 to parties of the UNFCCC.28 e past decade has been characterized as a “golden age”  for space-based atmospheric research. is is particularly true for the UT/S as, at peak, twelve limb/occultation sounders were operational on eight satellites. In contrast, in the coming decade only one occultation and one limb sounding instru- ment are planned to be launched by any agency or country. OMPS-LP 29 scheduled for launch on JPSS-2/3 30 in 2021/2026, respectively, will measure only ozone and aerosol. eir cov- erage, while dense, excludes nighttime regions, notably polar night (a shortcoming that ruled out consideration of similar techniques for a European “Operational Ozone” capability 31). Apart from that limitation, and the extended period of “blind- ness” that would follow any strong volcanic aerosol injection,32 OMPS-LP will likely meet most needs for daily near-global pro�le observations of ozone and aerosol aer 2021. For other critical UT/S measurements, however, the out-  look is bleak. Only SAGE-III,33 to be deployed on the ISS 34 in 2016, will measure UT/S water vapor. (SAGE-III will also  measure ozone, aerosol, and otherminor species.35)e sparse SAGE-III sampling, however, hinders its applicability to key scienti�c studies. For example, rising bands of moist and dry air in the tropical lower stratosphere (the “tape-recorder” sig- nature 36) give the best observational measure of the speed of the BDC 37 and its response to climate variability. Variations in this circulation have critical impacts on polar ozone loss 38 and on the stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone.39,40 e sporadic solar occultation sampling of the tropics (at best a handful of days each month) provides an inaccurate picture of these variations (see Figure 2 for HALOE41 example). Furthermore, neither SAGE-III nor OMPS-LP measure  other key UT/S species, notably: Tropospheric pollution tracers: Satellite observations of carbon monoxide have proven essential to studies of emissions, convection, and long-range transport.42,43 Species such as hydrogen cyanide and methyl chloride can help di�erenti- ate industrial, biomass burning, and biogenic sources.  Long-lived stratospheric tracers: Species such as nitrous oxide and/or methane provide unique information on transport and mixing. Knowledge of their stratospheric distribution is essential to understanding their lifetimes and, thus, cli- mate impact.44,45 Declines in controlled ODSs raise the importance of nitrous oxide for ozone layer stability.4  Stratospheric chlorine and bromine species: Such measure- ments are needed to quantify the balance between dynam- ical and chemical in uences on stratospheric ozone.4,14  Infrared andmicrowave limb sounders can �ll these critical ob- servational gaps. ese instrumentsmeasure thermal emission both day and night, have strong heritage, and o�er comple- mentary capabilities. While infrared sounders can typically measure to slightly lower altitudes (6 – 8 km lower limit vs. 8 – 10 km for microwave sounding), microwave instruments are signi�cantly less a�ected by aerosols and clouds, thus a�ording many more measurements of the tropical upper troposphere.  2    1995 2000 2005 2010 2015  -60  -30  0  30  60  La tit  ud e  2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0     Water Vapor at 100 hPa /  ppmv        0.30  0.35  0.40  0.45  r2 = 0.99  MLS  0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45  0.30  0.35  0.40  0.45  r2 = 0.52  HALOE  `True` wTR  / mm s -1  Sa te  lli te   s am  pl ed   w TR    /  m  m  s  -1  Figure 2: Left: Zonalmean timeseries of 100 hPawater vapor fromGOZCARDS 46 (UARS HALOE solar occultation to 2004, AuraMLS limb emission there- after).

From a technical readiness perspective, NASA ESTO49 has invested heavily in advancing the technologies needed for next-generation microwave limb sounders for composition and temperature. ese technologies enable (1) dramatic im- provements in horizontal, vertical, and temporal resolution, with coverage of the full diurnal cycle, while remaining within the same mass/power/cost envelope as previous sensors, and (2) substantial reductions in mass/power/cost/volume for in- struments making “continuity” measurements. anks to these investments, we expect no signi�cant tech-  nological barriers to implementing the “advanced microwave limb sounder” identi�ed for the Global Atmospheric Compo- sition Mission (GACM) recommended in the 2007 Decadal Survey.50 Approaches to providing signi�cantly improved ver- tical resolution (sub 1 km) within a low-cost (e.g., “Earth Ven- ture”) mission pro�le are also under development.  Question 3: Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  e global impacts of atmospheric composition on climate and air quality mandate a global perspective for composition observations, necessitating a space-based vantage point. is is particularly true for the UT/S, opportunities for in situ sam- pling of which are rarer than for lower altitudes. In addition, ground-based remote sounding observations of most UT/S species lack needed vertical resolution. Vertically resolved sonde and ground-based (e.g., lidar) observations from limited �xed locations are critical to validating and establishing con- tinuity between spaceborne sensors. For stratospheric water vapor, however, long-term trends derived from such records are unrepresentative of global variability.51  Point(b)  Process studies are increasingly capitalizing on both in situ and satellite composition observations.52–54 Tools such as dynamically based coordinate systems and Lagrangian tech- niques can overcome the dramatic resolution and coverage di�erences between such measurements. In addition to direct application to UT/S science, space-  borne limb observations of composition and temperature are important components of data assimilation systems and emerg- ing multi-sensor retrieval approaches yielding pro�les from the surface through the stratosphere with vertical resolution greater than that of individual instruments.55,56e unparal- leled insights derived from the “A-Train” constellation’s colo- cated observations of composition and other variables under- score the bene�ts that accrue from a comprehensive multi- sensor, multi-disciplinary approach to Earth observation.  1. Points addressed herein, as noted in the RFI: (a) Whether existing and planned US and international programs  will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identi�ed challenges and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?  (b) How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scienti�c questions and societal needs;  (c) The anticipated societal bene�ts; and (d) The science communities that would be involved  2.

Introduction 13   Weather covers atmospheric phenomena with time scales from minutes to about two weeks 14   and with spatial scales from local to global. It also covers the sub-seasonal to seasonal time scale 15   that bridges weather with climate.  16   Weather matters for life, health, safety, property, and economic prosperity. Weather 17   forecasts provide information that people and organizations can use to enhance these societal 18   benefits and to reduce weather-related losses. Despite its importance, however, in the past decade, 19   climate and earth system research has received much more attention than weather research in the 20   U.S.  21   As input for the NASA Earth Science Weather Focus Area advanced planning, a 22   community workshop was held in April 2015 to produce a report examining the scientific 23   challenges and opportunities in weather research. About 70 invited participants attended this 24   workshop, including individuals from government agencies, academia, the private sector, and 25   other national and international organizations. The Workshop mixed broad review talks, in-depth 26   research discussions, and more than 40 one-slide presentations on Day 1, followed by breakout 27   and plenary discussions on Day 2.  The full Report (including the list of participants) is available 28   at http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/focus-areas/earth-weather/. 29     2     This White Paper is based on the Workshop Report. It addresses all three questions in the 30   Request (science questions; their timeliness and readiness; and value of space-based 31   measurements) in Sections 2 and 3. It also covers all four issues (new investments versus 32   existing measurements; space-based versus other measurements; benefits; and science 33   community involvement) in Sections 1, 3, and 4.  34   Furthermore, Section 3 emphasizes the use of Observing System Simulation Experiments 35   (OSSEs) as a tool in measurement-related impacts and cost benefits analysis, while Section 4 36   emphasizes the importance of modeling, data assimilation (DA), and computing for applications 37   of space-based measurements. The science questions and recommendations below represent a 38   snapshot of the community’s views on selected topics most relevant to NASA’s observations, 39   research, and application portfolios, rather than a comprehensive review of all weather-related 40   topics. 41    42   2. Science questions 43   Using NASA’s capabilities in observations, modeling and DA systems, instrument 44   platforms, and computing facilities, a variety of fundamental science questions can be addressed 45   in the Weather Focus Area. For weather prediction and predictability: 46    What are the scientific advances and observations needed to expand the useful range of 47   weather forecasting from 0-2 weeks to 0-4 weeks?  48    What are the scientific advances and observations needed to extend and improve prediction 49   of extreme weather events (e.g., the snow events of the U.S. East Coast in 2015, the Texas 50   floods in 2015, hurricane Sandy in 2012, and the tornado outbreak on 25-28 April 2011)?  51    52     3     For convection and precipitation:  53    How do convective-scale and large-scale circulations interact?  54    What determines the mesoscale organization, internal structure and dynamics, and life cycle 55   of convective systems? 56    What modulates the rate at which convective storms intensify to produce severe weather, 57   tornadic storms, lightning, and other hazards? 58    What processes and interactions control the type, onset, rate, and accumulation of 59   precipitation?  60    61   For planetary boundary layer and land/ocean surface processes: 62    How does moist convection interact with the boundary layer and the surface? 63    What are the fundamental mechanisms controlling boundary layer clouds? 64    How can we unify the parameterization of moist and dry turbulence and convection as well 65   as clear air turbulence? 66    67   For clouds and radiation: 68    What processes determine cloud microphysical properties (ice clouds in particular) and their 69   connections to aerosols and precipitation? 70    What is the spatio-temporal structure of cloud systems? 71    72   Complete answers to these questions require a broad range of investments, from making 73   new observations designed to focus on processes at work in various parts of the Earth system, 74     4     through systematic modeling studies designed to examine processes at the micro- and macro-75   scale, as well as in the context of the global weather.  76   Further, as new components of the global observing system become feasible, quantitative 77   studies of their impacts and cost benefits need to be made, such as through the use of OSSEs. 78   Seeking answers to these questions led to seven recommendations below.  79    80   3. Measurements and OSSEs 81   The transitions from investment in new technologies to building new instruments, and to 82   developing new missions are an essential part of developing new observations.  Bringing new 83   missions to fruition requires methods to estimate the success of the technological development 84   and the likely cost effectiveness of the observations.  OSSEs provide a tool to assess the impacts 85   of new observations, in the context of the existing observing system, and hence contribute to 86   estimating the value of potential new missions. 87    88   Recommendation on OSSEs: The Weather Focus Area should take ownership of a NASA Earth 89   Science OSSE capability for assessing the impact of measurements and measurement systems on 90   the ability to answer weather and related science questions. In this way, mission systems trade 91   studies can be evaluated against science impact and mission cost and technology development. 92   Serious consideration should be given to increasing NASA and NOAA interagency 93   collaborations, including evolving the current shared OSSE elements into a common unified 94   infrastructure. 95    96     5     Recommendation on wind measurements: Global measurements of the spatio-temporal (four-97   dimensional) evolution of large-scale horizontal wind vectors are urgently needed. It is important 98   to avoid all or nothing strategies for the three-dimensional wind vector measurements, as 99   important progress is possible with less than comprehensive observing strategies. Some 100   additional tradeoff studies may still be needed to design the most cost-effective strategy for wind 101   measurements (based on lidar, radar, and atmospheric motion vectors) from satellites and 102   airborne flights.   103    104   Recommendation on temperature and humidity measurements: Continuous investment in 105   temperature and humidity measurements is needed, particularly focusing on higher spatial and 106   temporal resolution, and synergistic measurements involving multiple instruments, different 107   platforms (geosynchronous, low earth orbit, and airborne), and different types of satellites 108   (including small-sat and cubesat). Better measurements from space of the temperature, water 109   vapor, and wind in the boundary layer are needed, in particular to estimate more accurately from 110   space ocean/land surface turbulent fluxes that are closely coupled to boundary layer and 111   convection processes. 112    113   Recommendation on cloud and precipitation measurements: Continuous investment in cloud 114   and precipitation measurements is needed, particularly focusing on higher spatial and temporal 115   resolution, and synergistic measurements involving multiple instruments (e.g., radar, radiometer, 116   and lidar observations), different platforms (geosynchronous, low earth orbit, and airborne), and 117   different types of satellites (including small-sat and cubesat). Observational estimates of the 118   vertical velocity within convective systems are particularly important in this context.    119     6      120   New instrument technology maturity for making all of these measurements was also 121   examined during the workshop.  A key finding was that “The issue is not the ability to make the 122   measurement. It is the question of how comprehensive a measurement is needed to have impact 123   on science and forecast skill.”  There are tradeoffs in each measurement system that need to be 124   examined in order to get the best cost/benefit to the science. 125    126   4. Modeling, data assimilation, and computing 127   Modeling, DA, and high-end computing are an integral part of the NASA Weather Focus 128   Area. A sustained modeling and assimilation framework would also promote the transition of 129   suitable research-type observations into operational systems at NOAA.   130    131   Recommendation on modeling: Global high-resolution modeling (convective permitting with 132   grid sizes of 1-5 km) should be pursued as an essential contribution to the broad national and 133   international modeling activities and to NASA mission planning. This involves the research 134   support of dynamic core development, physical processes, software engineering, and high-135   performance computing. Research on, and development of, other high-resolution models (e.g. 136   mesoscale, cloud resolving and large-eddy simulation models) need to be pursued in parallel. 137    138   Recommendation on DA:  NASA should collaborate closely with operational and research 139   centers and support research on cutting-edge assimilation issues such as: hybrid ensemble-based 140   4-dimensional variational DA, all-sky radiance assimilation, assimilation of properties related to 141     7     clouds and radiation, land surface emissivity, coupled DA of the atmosphere-ocean-land-ice 142   system, and DA evaluation metrics. 143    144   Recommendation on computing: NASA should match supercomputing capability and capacity 145   with continued development of a high-resolution modeling capability directed at using all 146   observations to their fullest extent for weather prediction and for planning for new global 147   observations. Enhanced data-distribution techniques (e.g., storage proximal analytics) are needed 148   for data access and discovery. 149    150   These science questions and recommendations require NASA to work closely with other 151   agencies, academia, the private sector, and international partners. At the same time, NASA has a 152   unique role in weather research (as reflected by the above science questions and 153   recommendations) through the Weather Focus Area, relative to its partners. NASA is the only 154   agency in the U.S. with the capability to develop new technologies and satellite missions for the 155   above measurements. This also requires NASA’s leadership role in OSSEs.  156   While modeling, DA, and computing efforts are also covered by NOAA, NSF, DOD, and 157   the private sector, NASA’s unique role is to focus on modeling and DA that will help NASA 158   mission planning and assimilation of new measurements. In this way, NASA will accelerate the 159   transition of technology, instruments, observational data, modeling, and DA to operations (e.g., 160   at NOAA) and applications. This also requires NASA’s sustained investment in supercomputing 161   capability and capacity.  162   Finally, while NOAA, NSF, DOD, and, to a lesser extent, the private sector, perform 163   weather research, NASA’s unique role is to use its capabilities in instrument technology 164     8     development and new mission conceptualization to pioneer the next generation of instrument 165   platforms, observations, and modeling and DA systems to address these science questions.  166    ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"robert ferraro::john murray::steven pawson::carolyn reynolds::joao teixeira::"}

Why are  these challenges timely and in particular, why are space-based observations fundamental to  addressing these challenges?    Challenge 1.     What geophysical changes are taking place on and within the Earth?  What impacts do these  changes have on society?     Enhancing the integration of space and ground-based observing systems will continue to  support applied research, application development, operational infrastructures and judicious  governance of national and international policies.   Areas of interest that would see immediate  benefits are:     ·      Improves sea surface topography  ·      Improves geoid modeling  ·      Identify gravity changes over time  ·      Improves spatial resolution of gravity observations  ·      Supports sea level change monitoring  ·      Supports spatial and temporal resolutions for land deformation monitoring  ·      Supports Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) initiative  ·      Improves mass change detection and observations  ·      Improves measurements to discern geophysical signals         Challenge 2.     How do we accurately monitor geophysical changes over time?     The advent of the Global Positioning System has revolutionized many sectors of society during  the last 25 years.  Integrating Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) will further enhance  positioning, navigation and timing capabilities that will be an immediate benefit to the scientific,  commercial and private sectors.  From a scientific and commercial point of view, the integration  of GNSS can be used to define a highly stable and accurate terrestrial reference frame.  The  following areas of interest would benefit:     ·      Improves sea level change monitoring  ·      Improves subsidence monitoring locally and regionally  ·      Improves shoreline delineation and coastal change detection     ·      Improves sea level observations from global tide gauge network  ·      Improves tectonic plate motion modeling  ·      Supports Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) initiative  ·      Improves spatial and temporal resolutions of geospatial observations      Additionally, the integration of global geodetic networks with other observing systems (seismic,  ocean buoy, tide gauge, currents, atmospheric conditions) will enhance a number of  warning/monitoring systems and will provide additional resources for emergency responders,  urban and rural planners/administrators, transportation optimization and tracking as well as  enhancing airborne and space-based imaging capabilities.  Below are several high-visibility  systems that will benefit:     ·      Improves early warning systems – Tsunamis, Earthquakes, flooding & surges  ·      Improves emergency response time when natural hazards and events occur  ·      Improves coastal zone management and resilience initiatives  ·      Improves 3-D mapping  ·      Improves change detection  ·      Enhances feature/species identification         Additional Remarks  Space-based observations such as those from Earth observing systems and GNSS are  fundamental to addressing many scientific and operational challenges because they can provide  time and position information to datasets that are global, seamless and more valuable.   Freely  available access to these datasets also supports open source modeling of geophysical  phenomena and software products that could be used for many applications including some of  the more prominent such as monitoring, forecasting and enhanced decision making.

In this white paper we discuss observations that are important to the Grand Science Challenge on Clouds, Circulation and Climate Sensitivity based on activities undertaken so far. These include extensive community consultation and ten expert workshops in the US and Europe dedicated to better articulating the key challenges and to outlining and initiating a program of coordinated research around them. Through this process we identified four specific questions that stand out “both because of their centrality to a more specific understanding of global and regional climate changes, and because new and emerging approaches or insights are . . . making them more tractable” (Bony et al. 2015, doi:10.1038/ngeo2398) These questions are:  • What role does convection play in cloud feedbacks? • What controls the position, strength and variability of the storm tracks? • What controls the position, strength and variability of the tropical rain bands? • What role does convective aggregation play in climate?  Answers to these questions are essential for assessing the magnitude of global changes (climate sensitivity) and advancing predictions of regional climate changes. The former is important for mitigating against climate change, the latter central to adaptation measures.  1    Key Science Needs  We believe new observations are important for progress on three important issues:  Radiative coupling between clouds and circulation Cloud radiative effects pro- foundly influence the atmospheric circulation in both the tropics and extra-tropics across a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Cloud radiative effects have a strong in- fluence on the strength of extra-tropical storms and influence storm-track position and its sensitivity to perturbations. Similarly the position, strength and structure of tropical rain bands, including circulation systems such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and even the amplitude of decadal variability, are highly sensitive to how clouds interact with circulation through their radiative effects. New ap- proaches to synthesizing observations have demonstrated the possibility of constraining the atmospheric heat budget through a combination of well-calibrated, top-of-the-atmosphere irradiance measurements (e.g. from CERES) and atmospheric profiling of clouds (e.g. from CloudSat and Calipso). To constrain atmospheric energy and water budgets sufficiently to understand links between clouds and circulations, top-of-atmosphere measurements must be available at high sampling rates and must be augmented by estimates of surface turbulent heat and radiation fluxes.  Convective Aggregation Idealized modeling studies suggest that convection tends to spontaneously aggregate, leading to larger convective systems and systematically drier conditions outside the convective regions, with direct impacts for the top-of-atmosphere energy budget. This phenomenon is thought to be important to a variety of real-world phenomena including tropical storms, the MJO, and tropical rain bands (the monsoon, over land). Because the tendency to self-aggregate increases with temperature this mechanism may also affect Earth’s climate sensitivity. Current understanding of convective aggregation suggests an important role for low-level divergent circulations and the distribution of water vapor, both of which are quite poorly measured at present. An ability to measure profiles of water vapor in the lower troposphere and the profile of divergence throughout the troposphere is necessary to test current ideas about the mechanisms driving convective aggregation and the resulting impacts on climate.  Convection and Cloud Feedbacks The understanding of processes controlling cloud feedbacks, and hence Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity, have become increasingly pre- cise over the past years. Ideas have become sufficiently specific to encourage experimental and observational approaches for constraining the magnitude of such feedbacks. Here again the key questions are also related to the interplay of winds and water vapor. As one exam- ple lower tropospheric mixing, both as a result of convective processes and time-averaged large-scale circulation, scales strongly with feedbacks in models but is poorly constrained by observations. Proxies for small- and large-scale mixing are given by the structure and  2    depth of the moist layer over the tropical oceans. For this question, too, constraining water vapor anomalies in the lower tropospheres and the vertical profile of divergent circulation would constitute a tremendous advance.  Specific Measurements  Our comments below reflect the experience that, for climate and process purposes, it is not always necessary to achieve high precision at the time and space scale of the process since one can often aggregate data in a way that allows for testing process hypotheses over a large ensemble of process realizations. Successful recent examples include the compositing of observations around features of interest, including mid-latitude cyclones and the MJO, and the effectiveness of temporal and spatial averaging in answering process questions. Thus absolute accuracy and independence of errors may be more valuable than precision.  Lower Tropospheric Relative Humidity Water vapor in the lower troposphere is highly variable in space. Current observational estimates rely mainly on passive measure- ment of spectrally-resolved microwave and infrared radiances at the top of the atmosphere but such radiances are not very sensitive to water vapor near the surface. The resulting retrievals appear skillful, at least in clear skies, because they are well correlated with in situ observations, but this does not reflect true skill: passive measurements are primar- ily sensitive to relative humidity above the inversion and/or surface temperature, both of which are themselves highly correlated with lower tropospheric water vapor mixing ratio. This apparent skill is not sufficient because key scientific needs — including surface fluxes and impacts on cloud formation — depend on the small departures from these statistical relationships and so require accurate estimates of relative humidity and/or its vertical gra- dient at low levels. We also need these data underneath and around clouds which may require high spatial resolution sounders or active (e.g. lidar) methods.  3-D Wind profiling The planned ESA ADM-Aeolus mission (Doppler wind lidar) is an dramatic step forward in atmospheric wind profiling. The mission is purely exper- imental, however, and will a single component of the wind over a limited lifetime in a unique orbit, restricting the ability to use the observations in conjunction with others. Advanced 3-D global wind profiling would be a genuine revolution for process understand- ing, weather prediction, and climate science. Observing system simulations suggest that it could substantially improve the initialization of numerical weather prediction models. This is especially true in the tropics where wind is poorly constrained by temperature observations, but is also relevant at sub-synoptic scales in the extra-tropics which would help in predicting extreme wind storms. Co-located measurements of atmospheric winds, clouds and latent and radiative heating could also greatly advance understanding of atmo- spheric convection—still the Achilles heel of atmospheric modeling. Even the time-averaged  3    tropical overturning circulation is not accurately known and varies substantially between models are reanalyses. Pursuing space-borne measurements of atmospheric winds, using active and passive (microwave) systems, is a high-risk endeavor but one with the potential for extraordinary gains.  Atmospheric Energy Budget Nearly a decade of observation by satellite-borne active sensors (profiling radars and lidars) have transformed our understanding of the vertical dis- tribution of condensate (especially cloud ice) and aerosols. These measurements, especially when used to inform calibrated irradiance measurements at the top of the atmosphere, are often taken for granted but they are central to advancing understanding of the atmospheric heat budget and the coupling of clouds to circulation. The only mission planned to follow up on the A-Train’s success is ESA’s EarthCARE, but the likely short mission life and less capable instrument suite, relative to the A-Train, emphasizes the need to develop a comprehensive plan for the post-EarthCARE period. Understanding of the climate system, and especially the ability to detect changes in the vertical distribution of clouds to test ideas about cloud feedbacks, depends very much on our ability to maintain over the long term the types of measurements that the combination of CERES, CloudSat and Calipso provide. More precise and accurate measurements of the radiation budget at TOA, for instance through CLARREO-like approaches, would allow for independent measurements of ocean heat uptake and provide valuable new constraints on understanding of climate change and fluctuations at decadal timescales.  Expected Impacts and Involved Communities  The measurement program articulated above could substantially reduce uncertainty in estimates of Earth’s equilbrium climate sensitivity particularly at the high end where the risks are greatest the economic benefits of better information are largest. Observations of atmospheric heating derived from sustained observations of cloud profiles and top-of- atmosphere irradiance would better constrain understanding of processes responsible for the large-scale structure of atmospheric circulations systems, like the jets, storm-tracks and rain bands, thereby laying the foundation for understanding regional climate changes and adaptive strategies. Because atmospheric circulation affects every aspect of the climate system on all timescales, these measurements would greatly influence every aspect of Earth System Science, including attempts to understand the role of biospheric and cryospheric processes.  4   ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"sandrine bony::robert pincus::steven sherwood::masahiro watanabe::dargan frierson::christian jakob::masa kageyama::"}

Salinity is one of the fundamental properties of seawater and fluctuates greatly in the nearshore environment.   Knowing, understanding and being able to predict surface salinity is critical to understanding sea water density,  currents, and circulation patterns.  For example, in the coastal ocean, changes in salinity and temperature  patterns are important to understanding terrestrial and marine mixing zones.    Relating the variability in salinity  and nutrients nearshore to larval and juvenile fishes is key to ecosystem studies.         There is an acknowledged data gap in the spatial and temporal measurement of salinity in the global ocean  and particularly in estuarine and coastal regions (Geiger et al., 2013).  In Situ measurement systems are  difficult and expensive to maintain and offer limited spatial resolution.  Airborne microwave radiometers offer an  alternative data source but the missions are expensive and the missions have limited temporal and spatial  coverage.      The lack of salinity measurements with the required spatial and temporal resolution is a serious constraint to  modeling accuracy and effectiveness and severely limits model forecast capability (Wei et al., 2015).    For instance, the skill of the salinity forecasts of NOAA operational forecast are not satisfactory for mangers to  make decisions on freight loading of commercial vessels or beach closures due to the potential proximity of sea  nettles.    2 ) Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?    In NOAA, the benefits of an improved measurement capability would most directly affect operational  hydrodynamic modeling and ecological forecasting.    The NOAA/NOS Ocean Forecast Systems do not  adequately forecast salinity (and subsequently density) and the outputs cannot be applied operationally without  improved skill. Success of the NOAA Ecological Forecast Roadmap requires the implementation of nearshore  forecast models for HABS, hypoxia, pathogens and habitat (Allen, 2015).  Without improved skill in validating   and forecasting salinity, the ability to forecast water quality and density  will remain a significant challenge.      3)  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?    Significant strides have been made recently with satellite systems equipped with microwave radiometer  sensors (Klemas, 2011), but their optimal temporal and spatial footprint is focused on the global oceans and  not nearshore areas.  Satellite systems offer longer time series information on a regularly recurring basis and  provide products with the resolution needed to improve open ocean, coastal ocean, and estuarine models.

Key   Challenge   –   S2S   Prediction:   Science,   Operations   &   Applications      Demands    are    growing    rapidly    in    the   operational    prediction    and    applications   communities    for    environmental   forecasts    that    fill    the    gap    between   medium-­‐range   weather    (up    to   2   weeks)   and   multi-­‐season   (6-­‐12   months)   climate   forecasts.        This    intermediate    forecast   range    is    referred    to    as    Subseasonal    to   Seasonal    (aka    S2S).        Skillful    S2S   predictions    provide    important    and   valuable    opportunities    to    inform   decision   makers,   for   example,   of   changes   in    the    risk    of    extreme    events    or   opportunities    for    optimizing    resource   decisions.        Impacted    decision-­‐making   areas    include    water    availability    and   management,    agriculture    and    food   security,   energy   demand   and   production,   hazard    preparation    and    response,    etc.   Although   many   scientific   and   technological   challenges   remain   to   make   sub-­‐seasonal   forecasts   sufficiently    reliable,    skillful    and    tailored    for    users,    a    great    return    on    investment    is    to    be   expected    if    the    science    and    modeling    capabilities    associated    with    S2S    prediction    can    be   advanced.        These    technical    advances    hinge    on    maintaining    and    in    some    cases    enhancing   relevant   observing   resources             A. Science   The   scientific   basis    for   S2S   prediction    lies    in    identifying   sources   of   predictability   within    the   coupled    Earth    system   with    S2S    relevant    timescales,    and    on    our    ability    to    understand    these   processes    and   phenomena   well    enough    to    represent    them    in    a    global   modeling    framework.        The    importance,    potential    value    and   challenges    associated    with    S2S    prediction   are    described    more    completely    in    a    2010   National    Academies    of    Sciences,   Engineering,    and    Medicine    report,   sponsored    by    NOAA,    on    intraseasonal    to   interannual    climate    prediction    and   predictability    (NRC,    2010).    A    separate   Academies’   committee   is   currently   finalizing   a    report,    sponsored    in    part    by    NASA    and   ONR,    on    subseasonal    to    seasonal   forecasting,    which    will    update    the    2010   report    and    recommend    a    national    research   agenda    (release    expected    December    2015).   The   topic   was   also   highlighted   in   the   recent   NASA    Weather    Focus    Area    Workshop   Report   (NASA,   2015).          Satellite-­‐based    observations    represent    an    essential    resource    for    each    of    these    steps.        The   following   is   a   non-­‐exhaustive   list   of   high   level,   key   science   challenges   to   enable   improved   S2S   predictions:    § Identify    and    characterize    sources    of    S2S    predictability.        This    includes    natural   modes    of   variability   (e.g.   ENSO,   MJO,   IOD,   QBO),   slowly   evolving   earth   system   components   (e.g.   sea   ice,   soil   moisture,   snowpack,   ocean   heat   content),   and   some   elements   of   “external   forcing”   (e.g.   annual   cycle,   natural   or   anthropogenic   emissions   of   aerosols).          § Understand    and    quantify    how    the    above    identified    sources    of    predictability    individually   and    collectively    influence    the    development    of    disruptive    and    other    extreme    events    (e.g.   MJO   and   ENSO   influences   on   tropical   cyclone   locations/frequency   or   mid-­‐latitude   blocking   events,   multi-­‐scale   variations   of   the   monsoons).       § Develop    accurate    models/parameterizations    of    complex    sub-­‐grid    scale    processes    that   have    significant    importance    to    S2S    phenomena    and    the    sorts    of    predictability    sources   highlighted    above.        These    include   deep    convection    and   mesoscale    organization   of    storm   systems,   atmospheric   boundary    layer   processes,   aerosol-­‐cloud-­‐precipitation    interactions,   ocean   mixed-­‐layer   and   sea-­‐ice   processes,    land   surface   and   land-­‐atmospheric    interactions   involving   root   zone   and   surface   soil   moisture,   snow   processes   and   vegetation   dynamics.       § Identify    the    essential    elements    of    coupling    across    Earth    System    components    that    when   modeled   will    fully   exploit    the   available   predictability   and   provide   predictive    information   for   applications   and   societal   benefits.       B. Applied   Research   and   Operations   S2S    forecasting    is    at    a    relatively    early    stage    of    development    and    utilization,    bridging    a    gap   between   the   more   mature   weather   and   climate   prediction   communities.   Forecasting   the   day-­‐to-­‐day   weather    is   primarily   an   atmospheric    initial   condition   problem,   although   there   can   be   an    influence    from    ocean    and    land    conditions.    Forecasting    at    the    annual    and    longer    range   depends   strongly   on   the   slowly-­‐evolving   components   of   the   earth   system   such   as   ocean   heat   content.      Predicting   at   intermediate,   S2S,   timescales,   poses   unique   challenges   since   it   involves   many   processes   and   multi-­‐scale   interactions   that   operate   among   the   atmosphere,   ocean,   and   land    surface.    In    recent    years,    there    has    been    significantly    more    attention    given    to    this   intermediate    time    scale,    as    sources    of    predictability    have    become    better    understood    and   modeled   and   the   demand   for   a   seamless   suite   of   forecast   products   for   socio-­‐economic   benefits   grows   (e.g.   Barnston   et   al.   2009;   Brunet   et   al.   2010;   Gottschalck   et   al.   2010;   Lin   et   al.   2010;   Vitart   et   al.   2010;   Marshall   et   al.   2011,   2014,   Waliser   2011;   Zhang   2013;   Scaife   et   al.   2014;   Mo   and   Lyon   2015).         While    a    number   of    operational    forecast    centers   have   developed    S2S    forecast    systems,   most   are   experimental   –   particularly   at   the   subseasonal   range   –   and   the   national   and   international   community   is   collectively   working   to   develop   and   improve   these   systems   as   many   questions   and   challenges    remain    regarding    their   optimization,   potential    and   use.        Such   efforts    include   the   North   America   Multi-­‐Model    Ensemble    (NMME;   Kirtman    et    al.    2013)    and   World    Climate   Research   Program   (WCRP)   –   World   Weather   Research   Program   (WWRP)   joint   S2S   Prediction   Project   (Vitart   et   al.   2012).   Both   of   these   projects   are   based   on   quasi-­‐operational   (e.g.   informal   requirements   or   delayed   mode)   multi-­‐model   forecast   systems   primarily   designed   for   research   and    experimentation    –    with    both    science    and    applications    use    in    mind.        Along    with    the   intrinsic    science    challenges    highlighted    above,    there    are    additional    challenges    that    bear       directly   on   the   advancement   of   operational   capabilities.      Some   of   these   challenges   that   dovetail    with   the   need   for   space-­‐based   observations   are:    § Developing    optimal    strategies    for    initializing    an    S2S    forecasting    system,    considering    the   roles   and   predictability   associated   with   the   atmosphere,   ocean,   land   and   cryosphere.    § Developing/improving   the   initialization   of   surface   variables   critical   to   S2S   prediction   (e.g.   sea   ice,   snow,   soil   moisture,   ocean   mixed-­‐layer).    § Construction    of    initial    conditions    that    better    utilize    satellite    data    in    cloudy    and   precipitating    regions    where    significant    challenges    remain    in    data    assimilation   methodology.        Similarly,    contending    with    anthropogenic    sources    of    microwaves    that   confound   and   limit   use   of   passive   microwave   observations   (e.g.    for   soil   moisture,    freeze-­‐thaw).    § Reduction    of    model    systematic    errors    in    the    underlying    physical    processes    and    S2S   relevant   phenomena   that   affect   S2S   forecast   skill.    § Developing   coupled   atmosphere-­‐land-­‐ocean   data   assimilation   methodologies.    § Determining   optimal   verification   strategies,   including   measurements   and   metrics,   for   S2S   forecasts.    § Translating   S2S   forecast   information   into   actionable   information   for   societal   benefits   (e.g.   agriculture,    water    management,    energy    and    food    security,    public    health,    hazard   preparation   and   response),   as   well   as   developing   awareness   of   S2S   forecast   products,   and   sustaining   the   associated   resources   that   underpin   the   forecast   systems.    C. Applications      The    operational    S2S    forecast    systems    mentioned    above    are    typically    composed    of    coupled   land,    ocean    and    atmosphere    components,    providing,    in    some    cases    experimentally,    daily   ensemble   forecasts   of   a   wide   variety   of   physical   variables   with   subdaily   temporal   resolution   (e.g.   6   hours),   order   50-­‐100km   horizontal   resolution   and   with   lead   times   out   to   45   days   and   in   some   cases   180   days   or   more.      A   number   of   these   quantities   can   be   used   directly   for   decision   support    (e.g.    precipitation,    surface    temperature    and   wind,    upper    level   winds,    soil   moisture   and   evapotranspiration),   and   for   many   applications   can   be   used   to   subsequently   drive   other   component   models   used    for    applications    (e.g.    air    quality,    finer    scale   hydrology,    ocean   wave   modeling/ship   routing,   lake/coastal   hypoxia).      As   with   weather   forecasts,   the   range   and   depth   of   the   potential   impact   of   useful   S2S   forecasts   is   extensive.      Examples   of   use   and/or   expected   use    include:    1)    agriculture    at    a    local/regional    level    as   well    as    for    food    security    concerns    at   national    and    international    levels,    2)    water    availability    and    management    at    local/regional   levels    as    well    as    for    security    concerns    at    national    and    international    levels,    3)    hazard   preparation   and   response,    including    for    floods,    tropical   cyclone   and   other   severe   storms,   4)   health   considerations,   including   those   related   to   air   and   water   quality,   vector-­‐borne   diseases,   and    severe    heat    and    cold    conditions,    5)    energy    production    (e.g.    wind,    hydro)    and    demand   related    to    anomalous    temperature    conditions,    6)    transportation,    including    ship    routing    and   guidance   for   potential   Arctic   passages,   7)   military   planning   and   security   concerns   related   to   many   of   the   items   above.      While   the   potential   of   S2S   prediction   to   yield   actionable   information   in   these   areas   is   evident,   bringing   this   promise   to   fruition   still   requires   considerable   advances   in   both   research   (Section   I.A)   and   operations   (Section   I.B),   both   of   which   depend   critically   on   observations   (Section   III).             II. Timeliness   –   Substantial   Unexploited   Societal   Benefits   from   S2S   Predictions   While    many    end-­‐users    have    benefited    by    applying    weather    and    climate    forecasts    in    their   decision-­‐making,    there    remains    ample    evidence    to    suggest    that    such    information    is   underutilized    across    a    wide    range    of    economic    sectors    (e.g.,    Pielke    and    Carbone,    2002;   Hansen,    2002;   Morss    et    al.,    2008;   Rayner    et    al.,    2005;   O’Connor    et    al.,    2005;    Spillman    et    al.   2015).   This   may   be   explained   in   part   by   the   presence   of   ‘gaps’   in   our   forecasting   capabilities,   for    example    at    the    sub-­‐seasonal    scale    of    prediction,    by    a    lack    of    understanding    and   appreciation   of   the   complex   processes   and   numerous   facets   involved   in   decision   making,   and   often   major   gaps    in   access    to    forecasts   and   knowledge,   particularly    in   developing   countries.      While   assessing   the   economic   value   of   environmental   forecasts   is   difficult,   it   is   readily   evident   that   a   significant   portion   of   our   nation’s   economic   security   is   sensitive   to   weather/climate   and   on    the    availability    and    accuracy    of    the    associated    forecast    information    (e.g.    Dutton,    2002;   Morss   et   al.,   2005;   2008;   Lazo   et   al.   2005;   2008;   Thiaw   and   Kumar,   2014).   With   many   of   the   fundamental   prediction   components   in   place   (e.g.   weather   and   climate   prediction   systems   and   capabilities,   and   the   associated   means   of    information   dissemination),   coupled   with   evidence   of    the    significant    need    for    S2S    forecast    information    across    a   wide    array    of    decision-­‐making   areas,   S2S   prediction   represents   a   key   science   and   societal    challenge   area   ripe    for   attention   and   advancement.       III. Space-­‐based   Observations   –   A   Cornerstone   of   S2S   Predictions   Space-­‐based   observations   are   critical   to   sustaining   and   more   fully   developing   and   exploiting   S2S    predictions    for    societal    benefits.        The    space    observation    needs    can    most    simply    be   categorized   into   key   observation   sources   for   1)   operations,   and   thus   a   need   for   continuity,   2)   observations   that   need   to   be   further   developed   and   expected   to   be   essential   for   accurate   and   improved    operational    S2S    forecasting,    and    3)    observations    needed    to    improve    our   understanding    of    S2S    processes    and    phenomena    and    our    forecast    models’    capabilities    and   fidelity.        It    is   worth   emphasizing   that   along   with   space-­‐based   observations,   there    is   significant    need   for   complementary   in-­‐situ   networks   and   research   campaigns   for   synergistic   use   in   process    research,    satellite    measurement    validation,    and    the    development    and    validation    of    the    S2S    forecast   models.      Highlighted   below   is   a   non-­‐exhaustive   list   of   a   number   of   the   more   important   space-­‐based   observations   needed   for   sustaining   and   improving   S2S   prediction.          Operational   use/continuity   –   these   measurements,   already   available   and   in   use,   derive   from   one   or   more   well-­‐established    techniques   and   provide    foundational    support    for   S2S    forecast   systems,   including   for   assimilation,   verification   and   diagnostic   evaluation.        o Ocean   –   SST,   surface   winds,   sea   surface   height,   sea   ice   cover    o Atmosphere   –   temperature   and   humidity   profiles,   precipitation       o Land   Surface   –   temperature,   snow   cover     1) Research    need,    with    potential    operational    use    –    these    measurements    are    still   experimental    in    terms    of    their    measurement    approach,    use    and/or    impact    on    S2S   forecast    systems.    However,    given    their    critical    role    in    S2S    processes    and    sources    of   predictability,   they   are   expected   to   be   of   significant   benefit   to   S2S   forecast   fidelity.       o Ocean   –   sea   ice   thickness,   salinity    o Atmosphere    –    boundary    layer    information,    horizontal    winds,    aerosol   characterization       o Land    Surface    –    soil   moisture    (surface    and    root    zone),    snow   water    equivalent,   evapotranspiration    2) Research   need   –   at   present,    these   measurements   are   deemed    important    to    improve   our   understanding   and   modeling   of   processes   that   are   central   to   extending   the   range   and   accuracy   of   S2S   forecasts.        o Ocean   –   mixed-­‐layer   depth,   surface   currents    o Atmosphere   –   storm   vertical   motion,   aerosol-­‐cloud-­‐precipitation   interactions    o Land   Surface   –   vegetation   dynamics,   surface,   soil   and   groundwater   interactions   Note    that    for    a    number    of    the    measurements    above,    it    is    important    -­‐    for    process   understanding,    model    development    and/or    forecast    applications    -­‐    to    have    daily    and    in    a   number    of    cases    sub-­‐daily    sampling    for    resolving    the    diurnal    cycle,    particularly    for    the   atmosphere   and   ocean/land   surface.      Requirements   on   spatial   resolution   vary,   and   are   tied   to   a   combination   of   the   S2S   forecast   system   resolution   (10s   km)   and   the   given   quantity   and   its   scales   of   variability   (1-­‐100kms).            Critical    to    the    utility    of    a    number    of    remote    sensing    systems    is    the    maintenance    and/or   further    development    of    robust    in-­‐situ    networks    for    absolute    calibration    and    error   characterization.        It    is    recognized    that    few    if   any   of    the   remote   sensing   observations   can   be   use   effectively   without   adequate,   sustained   ground   validation   sites   /   networks.                 IV.

Introduction.  In a likely future of changing climatic conditions, the availability of water resources (or lack thereof) at a specific location or across regions of interest becomes a key factor leading to economic and societal stress.  Yet knowledge of future water availability remains largely unknown, with many climate model predictions disagreeing on both the amount and sign of moisture change in different regions [IPCC AR4, 2007].  Given that the Earth’s population lives overwhelmingly on land, information about the components of the terrestrial water cycle is particularly important in addressing the question of future water availability, and of these components, soil moisture is the primary state variable in land surface hydrology.  Although NASA’s SMAP and ESA’s SMOS missions are currently using L-band microwave technology for accurate soil moisture determination in all-weather conditions, no enhanced replacement missions (new missions that will exploit new technologies for enhancing the temporal and spatial resolution of products) are planned once these missions end their useful life in orbit in the coming years.  Thus, continuation of the observational record of critical microwave measurements (either follow-on or enhanced measurements) into the timeframe covered by the upcoming Decadal Survey is very uncertain.  At the time of this white paper submittal, the National Research Council has just released a recommendation that NASA determine the value and implementation priorities for data continuity [National Academies, 2015].    Need for Long Time Series Data Record.  The scientific value of terrestrial L-band observations will grow non-linearly as the length of the historical dataset is enhanced.  For example, prior to the ingestion of microwave brightness temperature observations, all land data assimilation systems require a climatological context for the ingestion – a multi-year (~decadal) record of equivalent measurements.  The current lack of such information severely hinders the performance of such modeling systems [Reichle and Koster, 2004].  Climatological soil moisture information is also required to utilize L-band datasets for applications (like agricultural drought monitoring) that are based on the detection of relative inter-annual variability in soil moisture.  In the specific case of agricultural drought, this requires the comparison of existing root-zone soil moisture conditions with past drought events with known end-to-season yield results.  The characterization by month or season of the statistics of soil moisture (and any associated derived product, such as evaporation rates or flooding potential) simply cannot be achieved with only a few years of data, and these statistics have direct impact on numerous applications (e.g., trafficability) and scientific analyses (e.g., characterizing the variability of the surface energy budget).  Long records are particularly needed for statistical or modeling studies of soil moisture impacts on weather because these impacts, while potentially important, can be subtle.  Finally, trend analysis must be conducted over decadal time scales given that trends are necessarily superposed on unrelated inter-annual variations.  Simply put, the value of L-band observations will compound as the datasets are lengthened.   While some soil moisture datasets do exist, their value is badly compromised by a lack of consistency between sensor types (e.g., transitions between passive and active-based sensors) and inconsistencies in the microwave frequencies utilized for retrieval [Loew et al., 2013].  In contrast, the recent success of Aquarius, SMOS, and SMAP cross-calibration efforts highlights the potential for consistency in L-band radiometry datasets acquired from different missions and different antenna designs, but all operating at the most appropriate low microwave frequency for accurate soil moisture determination.  Societal Benefit Example.  Agricultural drought monitoring has emerged as a major application for L-band terrestrial radiometry [Bolten and Crow, 2012].  In particular, recent evidence suggests that the relatively shallow penetration depth of microwave radiometers does not pose as serious a limitation as previously supposed [Qiu et al., 2014].  The relatively coarse spatial resolution of microwave sensors is not a large impediment to large-scale drought monitoring activities.  However, it does represent a serious limitation when considering drought mitigation.  Mitigation requires the resolution of individual agricultural/rangeland units (i.e., the scale at which discrete land management decisions are made).  Such efforts cannot be reliably-supported by coarse-scale retrievals reflecting average conditions across an array of managed and non-managed portions of the broader landscape.  The resolution issue is especially acute for irrigation agriculture where all relevant management information is spatially-restricted to a specific irrigation application unit.  As a result, a sharp increase in the value of L-band radiometry for food security applications can be expected as the resolution of satellite sensors starts to approach the typical management scales of dry-land and irrigation-based agriculture.  While such scales vary widely across the globe, 1 km is commonly assumed to represent the upper (i.e., coarser) edge of the management unit size distribution, and therefore is an aggressive resolution target for future L-band radiometry missions.  Needed New Technology Investments.  Achievement of finer spatial resolution with new L-band radiometer missions generally requires increased antenna aperture size.  Mechanical structure and dynamics technology innovation and engineering are needed to increase instrument antenna size 5 to 10-fold beyond the large 6-m antenna used by SMAP.  Both reflector (SMAP) and interferometer antenna technology (SMOS) need continued advancement to enable geophysical products (e.g. soil moisture) with greater resolution and accuracy in the future.  Dealing effectively with an environment of worsening radio frequency interference (RFI) is an ongoing challenge of increasing complexity, particularly at low frequencies (< 5 GHz) due to proliferation of broadband wireless communications.  On-board digital signal processing innovation is needed to keep pace with telecommunications advancements in order to provide on-board RFI detection and filtering and to manage the subsequent data downlink burden.  Links to Other Observations.  Accurate estimation of soil moisture from L-band brightness temperature measurements from space requires knowledge of other surface conditions, primarily soil temperature and overlying vegetation.  Determination of soil moisture would greatly benefit from simultaneous measurement of the scene temperature under clear/cloudy and all-weather conditions, such as achieved using a 37 GHz microwave radiometer, to complement the all-sky, all-weather capabilities of L-band sensors.  In addition, any improvements in visible/infrared and/or radar-based vegetation information at the spatial scale of new L-band missions would likely lead to associated improvements in soil moisture estimation.     Communities Involved.  Generation of a longer time series data record of L band-derived soil moisture measurements from follow-on or enhanced missions has obvious relevance to weather and climate assessments as already mentioned and to a wide variety of societal applications beyond the agricultural drought example given.  It is anticipated that such a data record would be supported and heavily utilized by the weather/climate, land surface hydrology, and agricultural communities, as well as the range of application users represented by the SMAP Early Adopter Program.

J., Kelbert, A., Rigler, E. J., U.S. Geological Survey A. Pulkkinen, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center  October 30, 2015  Keywords: Geomagnetism, Earth conductivity, natural hazards, space weather, induction  Geoelectric fields induced in the Earth's electrically conducting interior during geomagnetic storms can interfere with the operation of electric-power grids, damage transformers, and even cause blackouts. Coupled three-dimensional (3D) modeling of space weather events and the Earth’s electromagnetic induction effects could be used for real-time, operational evaluation of on-going induction hazards and for scenario analyses of extreme-events that might occur in the future (e.g. Love et al. 2014). Such modeling requires knowledge of 3D electrical conductivity structure of the deep Earth, particularly at lithospheric depths.  Earth conductivity can be estimated through interpretation of measured geomagnetic and geoelectric activity. Survey measurements of geomagnetic and geoelectric field variation across periods of 1-sec (and shorter) up to about 10,000-sec can be obtained from temporary, ground-level deployments of sensors (e.g. Chave & Jones 2012). These magnetotelluric data can be inverted to obtain local and regional models of Earth conductivity in the crust, lithosphere and upper mantle down to a depth of about 400 km (e.g., Meqbel et al, 2014 and many others). Magnetic field data collected with satellites (e.g. Friis-Christensen et al. 2006) and at magnetic observatories (e.g. Love & Chulliat 2013) can be interpreted at periods much longer than 1-day and inverted for deep Earth mantle conductivity across a depth range of about 400 -1600 km (e.g., Kuvshinov & Olsen 2006; Kelbert et al. 2009).   Improved fundamental understanding of Earth structure and improved assessments of induction hazards can be obtained from geoelectromagnetic analysis of the “dead-band” periods of 10,000-secs to 1-day through 3D modeling of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, ocean, and solid-Earth in coordination with enhanced geomagnetic field measurement. In particular, magnetic field data could be collected from multiple magnetometer satellites deployed simultaneously in a variety of low-Earth orbits (both polar and non-polar). These data and those from ground-based magnetic observatories would enable joint inversion for models of deep-Earth interior conductivity at lithospheric depths, and physics-based parameterization of the Earth’s surrounding geospace environment. The models would be validated by comparing predicted geoelectric fields against those directly measured. The models could also be used in forward calculations needed for operational hazard assessment.   Chave, A. D. & Jones, A. G., 2012. The Magnetotelluric Method, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, UK.

Historically, the main   distinction has been in terms of operational system availability and data latency requirements.  For the   NOAA polar and geostationary backbone satellite systems, that distinction is still true.  The GOES-R and   JPSS satellite systems both have data availability requirements that exceed 99%.  Data latencies for   these two systems are also driven by operational needs of the weather community and generally range   from 10’s of seconds to 10’s of minutes.  In general, all observational data applications for weather   operations are perishable, and the value of the observation can diminish rapidly with increased latency.     Nevertheless, a number of non-operational NASA research satellite systems supplemented by an   increasing number of arrangements with foreign satellite data providers are now, or soon will be, used   operationally.  Some examples include data from AQUA, GPM, SMAP, SENTINEL, RADARSAT, METEOSAT,   GCOM, ADM-AEOLUS and HIMAWARI.  This growing set of operationally relevant satellite data sources   along with improved numerical model data assimilation schemes are making the entire observational   system more robust and less likely to be impacted by a single system drop out.  Weather operations   would far prefer to have advanced satellite capabilities provided most of the time, than to not have   access to the data at all because of availability concerns.  In terms of latency, the practical data utility   ranges from seconds/minutes for lightning data to multiple hours/1-2 days for some hydrology and fire   weather applications.   Many of the next NASA decadal missions could be operationally relevant,   especially with the advent of advanced communications designs and data processing improvements.      Assuming latency and availability considerations make the data useful to operations; consideration also   needs to be given as to exactly how the data will be used.  Satellite data use in the NWS falls into two   general categories: 1) input to numerical weather models used in forecasting and 2) observational   situational awareness needed for accurate diagnostics and nowcasting and, in some circumstances, as a   supplement to warning decisions.  In terms of typical satellite systems definitions, Level-1 processed   data are generally applicable to numerical weather models and Level-2 and Level-3 processed data are   generally applied in situational awareness applications.  For situational awareness and forecast and   warning operations, the NWS uses the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), which   ingests, integrates, and displays model and observational data and contains the production software to   provide forecast and warning products to the public.   Advances in numerical modeling will drive many of the improvements to weather, water, and climate   forecasting over the next decade.  Higher spatial and temporal resolution, more cohesive atmospheric-  oceanic coupling, enhancements to fundamental physics packages, explicit modeling of convective   processes, and more sophisticated use of ensembles will form the basis for more accurate prediction   and development of calibrated probability information.  Critical to the value of any modeling system is   the accuracy and reliability of its analysis. Assimilation and integration of content from multiple   disparate observations, satellite data included, will be crucial inputs to the goal of creating a best state-    of-the-atmosphere, which is continuously updated through time to initialize these numerical guidance   products.   As to the human forecaster, the sheer volume of satellite-derived information available operationally is   multiplying rapidly, owing to the diversity of spectral channels providing data, the flexibility of scanning   strategies, and the low data latency alluded to earlier.  Considerable concern exists in the operational   community about optimizing the capability to utilize this diverse array of information to enhance   decision making while minimizing the potential for data overload or additional pressure on work   processes.     At the NWS Operations Proving Ground (OPG), Operational Readiness Evaluations (OREs) are conducted   to address these concerns. Forecasters are placed in a realistic operational setting and assigned a variety   tasks in which they attempt integrate new or experimental data/tools into their normal operating   practices. Typically, these evaluations are comprised of both historical cases and live weather scenarios.   In addition, there is intentional effort to test decision-making across a broad spectrum of situations (e.g.,   flooding, severe thunderstorms, winter weather, fire weather, fog, etc.), service sectors (e.g., emergency   management, aviation, marine, tropical, etc.), as well as multiple geographic locations.    Incorporating satellite imagery into weather analysis and forecasting tasks has historically been   accomplished by view (or animating) single-channel imagery, sometimes with surface observations   superimposed.  Evidence is mounting that the best way to integrate satellite imagery for future   operations may be through data fusion, merging multi-spectral combinations along with other data sets   such as high-resolution gridded model output.  Continuing to add data does not necessarily lead to   better forecasts. There are definite limits to how much information a forecaster can assimilate for high-  pressure decision making. Therefore, as considerations are made for deploying new tools or products,   attention must be paid to effective use of data, over and above the amount of data available. Identifying   the most valuable combinations, color schemes, and display strategies becomes a priority, along with   what training will be required to prepare forecasters to use the data properly, reliably, and intelligently.

Schmit  NOAA/NESDIS Center for SaTellite Applications and Research (STAR)  Steve Ackerman, Jun Li, Ralph Petersen, Dave Tobin   Description:   There are many potential uses for advanced high-spectral resolution infrared geostationary measurements: radiances, vertical moisture, atmospheric instability, improved atmospheric motion vectors, surface emissivity, cloud properties aerosols and trace gases. The geostationary perspective allows for a rapid refresh. There is a gap over the U.S.   Body:   A challenge is to better observe the vertical distribution of moisture on fine space and time scales, a key measurement for understanding dynamical and physical weather processes, especially for convection. These observations are needed to better monitor and predict rapidly changing conditions, often associated with convective-scale weather events.   Improved global observations of the vertical distribution of both temperature and moisture on large scales has been achieved using advanced infrared high spectral resolution sensors in low earth orbit (e.g., AIRS, IASI, and CrIS). These measurements allow for a better understanding of many atmospheric processes (Wulfmeyer et al, 2015). The largest impact of a given sensor in global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is the polar-orbiting advanced infrared sounder. It is these advances, in both the data and techniques to use the data that highlight the path forward to the geostationary orbit. While the polar-orbiting measurements offer global coverage, the refresh rate is fairly slow over a given location. Adding a finer time dimension associated with a geostationary orbit will bring similar improvements to the meso and regional scales. The sensor technology has matured and can now be applied to the geostationary perspective. Having similar observations from the geostationary perspective allows monitoring moisture on the same time scales that it changes on.  Several critical science questions remain, including: “How do convective-scale and large-scale circulations interact?  What determines the mesoscale organization, internal structure and dynamics, and life cycle of convective systems? What modulates the rate at which convective storms (of all types) intensify to produce severe weather, tornadic storms, lightning, and other hazards?” (NASA Weather Workshop Report, 2015). There are many potential uses for advanced high-spectral infrared geostationary measurements to help answer these and other questions. A high spectral (and hence vertical) resolution IR sounder with faster scanning is able to monitor important low-level information about the atmosphere and thus substantially improve the capability to forecast severe weather. The time sampling from the geostationary perspective and the high spectral resolution leads to many uses including: radiances for NWP, vertical moisture (near-casting), atmospheric instability for pre-convection situational awareness, improved atmospheric motion vectors, surface characterization, skin temperature, cloud properties, air quality and trace gases (ozone, SO2, etc.).  A high-spectral-resolution infrared (IR) sounder, originally called the Advanced Baseline Sounder (ABS) and then the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES), was slated to be on GOES-R as a companion to the ABI. In 2006, predominately because of budgetary pressure, the HES was removed from the GOES-R series. The scientific objectives for the instrument were justified. The many HES-related validation requirements remain unmet. In fact, when an ‘analysis of alternatives’ was investigated after the cancellation of the HES, it was determined that there was nothing else that could fill the observational hole, with respect to the measurements and derived products.   The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has stated the need for advanced geostationary sounders (WMO 2004; WMO 2009). This is consistent with the recommendations from a National Research Council (NRC) decadal study report to ‘‘develop a strategy to restore the previously planned capability to make high temporal- and vertical-resolution measurements of temperature and water vapor from geo orbit’’ and to achieve ‘‘essential sounding capabilities to be flown in the GOES-R time frame’’ (NRC 2007). EUMETSAT has documented, vetted and accepted the need for these advanced geostationary high time, high spectral measurements (EUMETSAT). Their first planned operational sensor (IRS: Infrared Sounder) is 2021. China’s plans call for an experimental advanced geostationary sensor (2016), followed quickly by two operational sensors. There is a great void over the Americas. No existing, nor planned, U.S. or international programs will provide high spectral resolution infrared observations over the Americans on the scales of an hour (or finer) and 10 km (or finer) spatial resolutions. High-spectral resolution infrared sensors operated in the geostationary orbit by the US would constitute the US contribution to this international effort.   The NWS (NWS Operational Requirements Document for the Evolution of Future NOAA Operational Geostationary Satellites, 1999) reiterated that the requirement for at least one temperature and humidity sounding every 10 km (single FOV pixel soundings to enhance mesoscale sounding capabilities) in clear areas at least every hour. The goal for the moisture profile accuracy was +/- 5%, implying high-spectral resolution. As technology advances, it is anticipated that there will be additional future requirements for sounding capability for measurements within areas of extensive cloud cover.  This has the benefit of allowing the monitoring of rapidly changing precondition situations, particularly threshold values, for forecasting severe weather conditions. According to a National Weather Service (NWS) memo from September 15, 2010, the need for an advanced geostationary infrared geostationary sensor was the top request in the geostationary orbit, including the “advantage of the increase in temporal refresh”.  These advanced space-based observations would not be used alone, but fused with other measurements. For example, numerical weather prediction output, surface and aircraft observations and other satellite measurements have been fused and analyzed with today's low spectral resolution geostationary sounders. The increasingly fine space and time resolution of regional models need improved data to initialize the fields and the rapid refresh from the geostationary is needed for improving regional models. Much larger positive impact is expected due to increased vertical resolution, surface emissivity, cloud characterizations and better definition of low level moisture. A former director of NOAA’s NCEP has stated “…the more you repeat the information inflow into the numerical  prediction system (the 4th “D” in 4DVAR) the more the model should hold onto that info and sustain the more accurate model results from run to run. Given the proposed temporal resolution of the GOES HES, this observing system should be a natural for any 4 D assimilation system.” A number of Quick OSSEs have demonstrated the utility of high spectral resolution infrared measurements (Li and Lui, 2009; Lui and Li, 2010; Wang et al, 2015; Jing et al, 2014).  The anticipated scientific and societal benefits are large, estimated to be in the billions of dollars.  Recent results show that the potential additional [over the current GOES] socioeconomic benefits for an advanced (high spectral resolution) sounder are estimated to be $4.2 billion (U.S. dollars net present value; Bard et al. 2008). The $4.2 billion estimate may be conservative because only five economic sectors were included. These values change if less conservative assumptions are used for the discount rate and/or inflation rate. In addition, the benefits to a host of users or application areas were not included in the studies, such as the Department of Defense or international users, nor were applications related to human health or other agricultural sectors. (Schmit et al, 2009).  The science communities that would be involved cover many phenomena. This include, but are not limited to: pre-convection profiles and warnings (Huang et al, 1992; Wang et al, 2007; Li et al. 2012), hazards (volcanic plumes (Ackerman et al, 2008); dust (Sokolik et al, 2002) and aerosols), land (surface emissivity (Li et al, 2012) and skin temperature), and the atmosphere (moisture (Smith and co-authors, 1990), clouds (Smith et al, 1993; Holz et al, 2006)), atmospheric motion vectors, air quality (Fishman et al, 2008), aviation safety, trace gases (Barnet et al, 2004), and infrared calibration (Tobin et al, 2006), etc). These communities would be international in scope, building on the experiences of EUMETSAT and others.   A path forward is clear that leverages earlier work, both in terms of the instrumentation and the data uses. As was stated by Hayden and Schmit, 1991 “...there seems little question that high spectral resolution, geostationary sounding will come eventually”. The need for these measurements is evident, and the instrument approach is known, the time is now to fill in this large observational void.

Given the importance of low  clouds to climate, we urge the Decadal Survey to endorse a strong, dedicated effort to continue  satellite-based observations of low clouds using current techniques, and to develop and improve  upon existing capabilities.         Cloud-aerosol interactions are addressed in other white papers. The improvements to  satellite observations of low clouds and boundary layer structure described below would also be  valuable in addressing those issues.   What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   The recent National Academy of Sciences report “Continuity of NASA Earth  Observations from Space: A Value Framework” recommends that reduction of the uncertainty in  equilibrium climate sensitivity should be a NASA priority. Shallow clouds (cumulus,  stratocumulus, stratus) are the greatest source of spread in model estimates of climate sensitivity  and thus uncertainty in the magnitude of future climate change. Several recent lines of evidence  suggest that low clouds will enhance climate warming, but uncertainty about low cloud response  to climate change, including coupling to the global circulation, remains large.    Underestimates of Southern Ocean low clouds in climate models have global and  regional significance, affecting global and inter-hemispheric energy balance (likely connected to  the common model error of having a double Intertropical Convergence Zone).  Mixed-phase low  cloud behavior varies widely among models because of inadequate understanding of the physics  controlling partitioning of liquid and ice, which have different radiative properties.  This  introduces uncertainty into projections of Arctic sea ice decline. Interactions between climate  changes in high-latitude low clouds, sea ice changes, and weather have been proposed but are  poorly constrained.   Errors in the simulated transition from shallow to deep convection are thought to explain  the inability of models to simulate features of climate variability that involve the organization of     deep convection on large scales (MJO, monsoons), as well as model biases in the diurnal cycle of  continental precipitation.   For these reasons low clouds are central to three of the four guiding questions of the  WCRP Grand Challenge on Clouds, Circulation, and Climate Sensitivity: (1) What role does  convection play in cloud feedback? (2) What controls the position, strength, and variability of the  tropical rain belts? (3) What role does convective aggregation play in climate?   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Satellite data records are now approaching the length needed to detect regional secular  trends as the signal from climate change emerges from natural variability. Immediate focused  observations are needed to determine whether the predicted decline in low clouds as the climate  warms, and their enhancement of greenhouse gas warming, is realistic. Existing technology can  accomplish this with reasonable investments, and research missions optimized to observe low  clouds can be combined with operational weather satellites to produce comprehensive spatial- temporal sampling.   Longer records will also allow more precise determination of the sensitivity of low  clouds to environmental parameters from natural climate variability, leading to reduced  uncertainty in prediction of how low clouds feedback on greenhouse warming.   Future observations would benefit from almost a decade’s experiences with the A-Train  and ground-based “supersites,” especially the maturation of observational strategies using  information from multiple sensors to determine vertically-resolved macro- and micro-physical  information.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   Low cloud feedbacks occur primarily over broad regions of the ocean where in situ and  surface remote sensing observations are sparse or absent. Even over land, many climatically  sensitive regions (e.g., Amazonia, Africa) have little or no routine local cloud observations.   Modes of climatic variability affected by low clouds (e.g., MJO) have their genesis over  remote ocean areas and must be observed as planetary-scale phenomena to be understood. Global  coverage by satellites is required to monitor dynamically-induced shifts in low cloud patterns.   Please focus on the role of space-based observations and comment on:   a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities  necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If  not, what additional investments are needed?   The A-Train constellation has had a tremendous impact on understanding of low clouds  and their role in climate, in particular on drizzle formation and instantaneous cloud forcing.  However, A-Train instruments are nearing end-of-life and urgently need to be replaced and     nominally upgraded to provide continuity with current data, better detect clouds near the surface,  reduce uncertainties in retrieved low cloud properties, and provide better information about the  environment in which low clouds are embedded.    Mixed-phase clouds in particular remain challenging and likely require a new focus on  3D observing systems. Active instruments combined with passive microwave, visible, and  infrared are key. The planned ESA EarthCare mission will provide some degree of cloud radar  data continuity, but with no passive microwave, very limited VIS/NIR information, and a short  mission life (owing in part to a low earth orbit and increased atmospheric drag relative to the A- Train).   Challenges are especially acute in capturing atmospheric dynamics from satellites.  Meteorological (re-)analyses informed by passive microwave and infrared sounders are currently  the only source of global large-scale information but winds and water vapor in and near the  boundary layer, which are central to the behavior of low clouds, are highly uncertain over remote  regions.  Better estimates of surface turbulent fluxes, partly constrained by satellite  measurements of winds, are also needed. Better knowledge of dynamical fields would allow for  deeper understanding of the development and persistence of marine stratocumulus, the transition  from stratocumulus to trade cumulus, and the presence or absence of drizzle and light rain. The  planned ESA ADM-Aeolus mission will provide a first taste of the value of such measurements.   Therefore, in addition to maintaining passive microwave and cloud lidar capabilities, we  strongly recommend continuation of the A-Train with:    1. Millimeter cloud radar with higher vertical resolution than CloudSat to better detect  near-surface clouds and precipitation, and capture shallow cloud vertical structure. Scanning  over even a narrow swath would greatly reduce CloudSat sampling limitations that restrict it to  primarily statistical studies.    2. Multichannel vis-IR imager(s) with 100 m or better spatial resolution and nominal  multi-angle polarization capability.  Increased resolution will reduce the partial coverage of low  clouds in a large fraction of pixels with current sensors, which currently limits our ability to  confidently determine cloud fraction, optical depth, and particle size distributions. Multi-angle  polarization imagers could use stereo techniques to derive accurate cloud top heights.  Polarization angular dependence provides cloud top particle size and thermodynamic phase  along with aerosol properties.   3. The existing Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS sensors provide high-resolution imaging of maritime  low clouds near islands and coasts, as will the planned Landsat-9. These data are presently  under-utilized for low clouds and a broader strategy for Landsat-10 should be considered.    4. In the longer term, emerging technologies such as Doppler radar and wind lidar, water  vapor differential absorption (DIAL) or Raman lidar can advance understanding of PBL  dynamics and thermodynamic structure that determine the type and spatial extent of low clouds.   Routine, less expensive time lapse (stereo) imaging (from cubesats) may also prove effective.      We recommend a strong suborbital program to advance these technologies for eventual use in  space-borne observations of low clouds.    b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for  addressing key scientific questions and societal needs   Surface-based remote sensing (e.g., ARM facilities) could be better utilized to  complement satellite data (continuous point data vs. global data with long repeat time) and  validate satellite algorithms.   Geostationary data can be better exploited to provide a global temporal context for  snapshot low Earth orbit observations.   Satellite data combined with reanalysis fields of non-observed parameters will optimize  science impact. More data products should be assimilated into models and state-of-the-art  assimilation techniques adopted in the U.S.    c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits   Assessing future climate impacts requires knowing how much we expect the climate to  change for a given forcing. Low clouds determine this response to a greater extent than any other  part of the climate system, and improvement in this area is a high priority.   Interactions between shallow and deep clouds affect weather prediction on many time  scales. Predicting tropical rainy period onset will benefit from increased medium-range  predictability to be gained by better simulation of intraseasonal variability. Correct daily timing  of continental precipitation may allow for better projections of soil moisture anomalies in a  warming climate.  Circulation responses to changing patterns of low clouds may change weather  patterns and rainfall distributions.   d. The science communities that would be involved.   A commitment to enhanced observations of low clouds will influence the priorities of  WCRP and GEWEX and have an impact on IPCC assessments.  The remote sensing, cloud-scale  modeling, climate modeling, tropical meteorology, numerical weather prediction, and climate  impacts communities would all participate in designing and implementing an observational  strategy, learning from the observations, and transferring knowledge to improve models and have  more confidence in the impacts they predict.

The high temporal resolution would help better characterize accurate emissivity, which will benefit many applications: land surface modeling, radiance assimilation, and many satellite remote sensing products.  Body: (limit 1500 words -- currently at 923 !!!)  Land surface emissivity (LSE) is the relative ability of the land surface to emit energy by radiation. It is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated by the land surface to energy radiated by a blackbody at the same temperature. Infrared (IR) LSE varies with land surface type, viewing angle, and time following changes in the state of soil moisture, vegetation, and weather conditions, such as dew/frost formation, evaporation, rainfall, or snowfall.  Accurate IR LSE are needed by many applications in weather, climate, and environmental studies, such as land surface modeling, numerical weather prediction (NWP), as well as deriving other satellite products. Land surface models, an important component in weather and climate models, can have significant errors in lower atmosphere simulation (e.g. land surface energy budget, land surface temperature etc) with incorrect LSE. These errors can lead to decreased predictive skill for near surface operational products (e.g. 2-meter temperature, Jin and Liang 2006). Progress has been made in assimilating satellite IR radiances to improve weather forecasting skills (Le Marshall et al., 2006). However, current LSE products do not meet the requirement to allow assimilating satellite radiances in thermal IR region (8-12 micron). Radiances from this spectral region contain critical information about surface and lower atmosphere, where storms usually originate. Currently, LSE diurnal variation is not considered in both NWP and climate models, and emissivity diurnal information is needed from space-based observations for weather and climate modeling and prediction.  Accurate IR LSE is also needed for deriving many other satellite products, such as temperature and moisture soundings, total precipitable water, land surface temperature, radiation budget, trace gas retrievals, dust and aerosol property retrievals, and the cloud-top pressure (CTP) product.  LSE can be measured through laboratory analysis or estimated through satellite remote sensing. LSE varies temporally, spatially, and spectrally. It is practically impossible for laboratory analysis to capture these variations on a global scale. Methodologies for extracting LSE from radiance observations from polar orbiting broadband and hyperspectral IR sounders have been developed (Li et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2011). Several monthly global LSE databases (e.g. MODIS, AIRS, and IASI) have been generated and are available publicly for research and operational use. Studies have shown that these global emissivity spectra depict surface type properties very well (Li and Li 2008).  Compared with polar orbits, geostationary orbits offer a unique advantage to further improve LSE products. With geostationary high-spectral-resolution IR radiances, hemispheric surface emissivity spectra could be derived hourly. The high temporal resolution from geostationary orbits not only adds one additional dimension of the emissivity products, but also offers an opportunity to further improve the retrieval quality for single time step. Such an algorithm to take advantage of geostationary high temporal resolution has been developed for the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Nation’s next generation of geostationary satellites, the GOES-R (called GOES-R ABI LSE algorithm, Li et al. 2011) and has been successfully tested with SEVIRI. The so-called time continuity, which assumes LSE does not vary during a short period of time while land surface temperature varies, was taken into consideration to strength the emissivity signal, and has been proven useful to improve the emissivity quality.  Application of GOES-R ABI LSE algorithm to SEVIRI (Li et al. 2012) reveals a wavelike LSE diurnal variation----LSE decreases with reduced soil moisture due to evaporation during the day, and increases with increased soil moisture due to adsorption in the evening. This new finding is contradictory to previous understandings. Before, it was widely accepted that LSE only changes very slowly with vegetation cover when there is no precipitation; there should be no strong temporal variations in LSE in a short period of time (e.g. days to weeks). This new finding indicates that the existing monthly LSE databases are not accurate enough for many applications due to the lack of diurnal variation. This is one important reason why the utilization of existing LSE databases is limited.  While SEVIRI is able to accurately characterize the LSE to show the diurnal variations, it is only valid for three broadband window channels. For a broader application, a geostationary hyperspectral IR sounders is needed in order to better characterize the LSE with high temporal, high spatial, and high spectral resolutions. And such LSE products can only be derived from geostationary hyperspectral IR sounders.  A hyperspectral IR sounder, called Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES), was originally planned for GOES-R program, but later was dropped due to budget issues. While ABI with 10 IR spectral bands will be able to continue the legacy products of GOES satellites (Schmit et al. 2005), it is nowhere near what a hyperspectral IR sounder can provide. A geostationary hyperspectral IR sounder would improve all existing products dramatically, and likely produce new products that are not possible with traditional GOES broadband IR sensors. For example, Although conventional imagers such as ABI can detect dust events, a high-spectral-resolution instrument can better characterize the plume. Information can be retrieved regarding the height, loading, and possibly the composition (Hong et al. 2006). A geostationary hyperspectral IR sounder will surely help the National Weather Service (NWS) to fulfill its goal of a “Weather-Ready Nation” and support its new Impact-based Decision Support Services (IDSS).

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations  in the coming Decade?     Humans have altered the landscape by changing the vegetation cover over centuries but  with increasing intensity over the latest decades.  As a result two of the most critical  fluxes in the water cycle have already changed by orders of magnitude.  Recharge to  aquifers and evapotranspiration from the landscape are two fluxes that are most  dramatically changed in the historical era as a result of human alteration of the landscape.      Understanding how recharge and  evapotranspiration have already  changed and what consequences their  changes have on: 1) sustainability of  aquifers, 2) crop productivity, 3)  ecosystems health and 4)  climate are  priority questions in Earth System  Science. Despite the importance of  these fluxes and their historical  change, there are no direct  measurements – in situ or by remote  sensing - that can allow any mapping  or any global or regional estimation.    Because evapotranspiration and recharge are also key conduits for biogeochemical  substances, they are also critical to Earth’s biogeochemical cycles.     Evapotranspiration  and recharge can  amplify changes in  precipitation and  radiative forcing.   Small changes in the  magnitude,  seasonality and  intermittency of precipitation and radiation can be magnified in the recharge and  evapotranspiration signals.  As a result, the future of these two critical fluxes under a  changing atmospheric composition may be even more uncertain.             NRC (1999): Hydrologic Science Priorities for the U.S.  Global Change Research Program    … Evaporative flux linking the surface and atmospheric  systems and the recharge flux linking the surface and  subsurface systems are two key components of the  hydrologic cycle that are poorly understood and are very  poorly monitored. It is imperative that the  characterization of these two fluxes be recognized as  grand challenges for hydrologic science…   Bondeau et al., Global Change Biology (2007)    Agriculture profoundly affects global carbon, water and nutrient cycles,  as well as the planetary surface energy balance… Accounting for  croplands, pastures and rangelands, nearly 50% of the potentially  vegetated land surface has been affected by agriculture.”       Given:  • the central role of recharge and evapotranspiration in the global water,  energy   and biogeochemical cycles,   • the need to quantify and map the rate of sustainable aquifer use,   • the importance of the these fluxes to the health of natural and agricultural   ecosystems,   • the already-realized several-fold changes in these fluxes through human   alterations of the landscape,   • the potential for amplified change in these fluxes under climate change,  • the paucity – or total lack – of any direct estimates of these fluxes regionally and   globally,   understanding recharge to aquifers, evapotranspiration and their linkages is a grand  challenge for Earth System Science in the coming decade.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with  respect to readiness?     Recharge and evapotranspiration fields have already changed, often by large magnitudes.  The rates and spatial patterns continue to change as humans further modify the physical  landscape and alter the vegetation cover. Basic questions include:    What are the rates of change of evapotranspiration and recharge?    These rates remain unaddressed and essentially unknown.  Even the climatology of these  two critical fluxes is unknown other than as residual of differences between other fluxes.    To understand their historical change, current state and future outlook, a more complete  understanding of the processes that drive variations in these fluxes is essential.     How do the rates of evapotranspiration and recharge respond to human alterations to the  physical landscape and vegetation cover and to shifts in climate and its seasonality?    These changes remain as gaps in our knowledge of how the Earth System works.  Understanding them is essential if we are to become better stewards of the terrestrial  biosphere that we have appropriated so pervasively.    Recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes can experience changes that amplify shifts in the  precipitation and radiation  forcing. Knowledge of changes  in their magnitude and regional  patterns in the future are critical  to understanding the impacts of  climate change.         Miralles et al., Hydrology and Earth System Science (2011)    Evaporation remains one of the biggest unknowns within the  global water balance. Improved representation of its global  dynamics is essential to lead to a better understanding of  the expected acceleration of the hydrological cycle.        How do the rates of evapotranspiration and recharge respond to changes in precipitation  and radiation forcing?    These rates are not understood and they are a source of uncertainty in assessment of  climate change impacts.     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?      Recharge and evapotranspiration are fluxes at the land-atmosphere interface.  Their  spatial variations are strongly related to soil type, topography, vegetation and climate.   Their dynamics are affected by the variations in plant growth, weather and seasonal  climate.  To adequately characterize them mapping at tens to hundreds of meters and  temporal sampling at days to a week are needed at minimum. Also as fluxes they cannot  be directly sensed as they do not uniquely correspond to the thermal or dielectric state of  the soil and the vegetation at one level. Rather they are controlled by vertical and  temporal gradients of state  variables.     Soil moisture is the  fundamental state variable  that directly controls both  recharge and  evapotranspiration. Vertical  gradients in soil moisture  drive recharge and regulate  evapotranspiration. Vertical  profiles of soil moisture  need to be measured in  order to allow estimation of  these fluxes. In situ  monitoring is not a viable  approach for collecting the  required data. Observations  are needed that span large  areas, but installing and  maintaining  instrumentation at even a  single site is costly and  challenging.         Space-based observations  can provide the necessary  data, as long as the sensing  system includes three key  attributes. The first attribute   Facts Box  Recharge and evapotranspiration are:   1. Fluxes that are first-order determinants of biogeochemical cycles.  Water is  the ultimate solvent and recharge and evapotranspiration are the circulatory  system of biogeochemicals in the Earth System   2. Fluxes that link the slow and fast components of the water cycle. The  atmosphere water vapor residence-time is about 9 days, the average residence- time of water in the land subsurface is about 8 years and the residence-time of  water in the oceans is about 2500 years. Nevertheless they together constitute  the global water cycle with evapotranspiration and recharge among the fluxes  that link the storage components.    3. Fluxes that to first-order determine and to first-order are determined by  vegetation distribution.  Where vegetation grows is influenced by the  availability of water and the trade-off between evaporative and recharge losses.  At the same time, the rate of recharge and the rate of evapotranspiration are  determined by vegetation species and its health status. The fluxes and the  vegetation distribution are intimately linked and each is a first-order  determinant of another.   4. Fluxes that limit rate of sustainable use of surface waters and  groundwater aquifers. The rate at which we can pump water out of  freshwater aquifers in a sustainable way is the recharge rate. Remarkably this  flux has a shared definition in both Earth System Science and in water  resources management practice.    5. Fluxes that have most dramatically changed already in response to human  activity. Over the recent historical period, human alteration of the physical  landscape and transformation of terrestrial ecosystems have resulted in changes  in recharge and evapotranspiration that are several-fold and possibly orders-of- magnitude.  We need to understand the past history of changes in these critical  fluxes, assess their current state and project their prospects under a changing  climate. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding the metabolism of  the Earth System and its linked cycles and to the rational management of our  agricultural and water resources systems.     of the appropriate sensing system is observations at multiple wave frequencies to probe  multiple depths.  Multi-frequency with varying penetration depth into the soil will  provide vertical profiles of soil moisture. A second attribute of the appropriate sensing  system is defined by the need to sense the interface across which these fluxes are  occurring. The atmosphere and the vegetation canopy that stands in between a space- borne sensor and the flux interface needs to be as transparent, or at least quantifiable, as  possible.  This consideration leads to the selection of low-frequency microwave bands  (L-band and below) for the multi-frequency-channel system. A final set of attributes of  the appropriate sensing system is that it should have both sensitivity and resolution.  Sensitivity is required if gradients in states and not the states themselves are the basis for  estimation. Spatial resolution is required since the variations in soil type, topography,  solar aspect and vegetation that drive recharge and evapotranspiration occur on a wide  spectrum of spatial scales. The sensitivity and resolution requirements lead to the  selection of combined active and passive low-frequency microwave sensors.    Therefore a desirable space-based sensors should be: 1) multi-channel, 2) low-frequency  microwave, 3) active (radar) and passive (radiometer).  A sensor package that combines  all of these attributes is L- and P-band active passive. There is considerable air-borne and  some space-borne heritage for such instruments, and their capabilities for sensing the  relevant surface and root zone states have been demonstrated.    a) Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the  capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and  associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?     Several space programs, including JAXA’s PALSAR-2 (L-band active), NASA’s SMAP  (L-band active passive), NASA/ISRO’s NISAR (L-/S-band Active), ESA’s Biomass (P- band active) and CONAE’s SAOCOM (L-band active), are operational or in the  development phase. They address individual observation capabilities, but not the  combined multifrequency (L-/P-band) active passive observation requirements. The ESA  Biomass mission P-band radar revisit rates are only seasonal. They are appropriate for  biomass mapping but not for capturing surface water balance dynamics. The L-band SAR  missions also have revisit rates of tens of days. The future combined L-/P-band system  will require an operations concept that covers a wide swath for frequent revisit. A space  system study is required to determine the architecture of a space-based sensing system for  the multi-frequency active-passive observation requirement and to identify required  technology development.     An active-passive L-/P-band system would also support continuity of surface soil  moisture estimation using the NASA SMAP and ESA SMOS missions. Soil moisture is  the state variable of the land branch of the water cycle. It has temporal variations ranging  from weather to interannual.  Long climate records are needed to characterize the  variability of the water, energy and carbon cycles as affected by the soil moisture state.  L-band radiometry of the Earth System has been continuous since 2009.  The active- passive L-/P-band system will not only support the needed climate record but also  enhance the capability for deeper sensing of the soil column that is more representative of     the land branch of the water cycle. The system will also support higher spatial resolution  to capture the heterogeneities induced by variations in topography, vegetation type, soil  texture and precipitation intermittency.       b) How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the  value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs?     The fluxes are related to gradients in the thermal and moisture (dielectric) states but  nevertheless physics and factors related to the soil and vegetation properties need to be  used as constraints in the retrieval from space-based observations.  This means that a  model value-added or data assimilation approach needs to be used in order to realize the  science of the proposed set of space-borne measurements.  To realize the societal benefits  of the new knowledge, the retrievals have to be linked to observations of human-managed  systems. The recharge fields need to be interpreted in the context of aquifer water-level  observations. Crop productivity and yield information should be interpreted side-by-side  with the evapotranspiration field estimates.       c) The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and     The recharge rate is exactly the rate of the  sustainable use of subsurface aquifers.  This  hydrologic flux is unique in that it has the  same definition in an Earth System Science  context and in operational water resources  management.  Evapotranspiration is the link  between the water, energy and  biogeochemical cycles at the land- atmosphere interface. Variations in the land branch of these three fundamental cycles of  the Earth System would be essentially independent if it were not for the  evapotranspiration flux that links the three. Understanding how the Earth System works  and projections of how its metabolism will evolve in a changing climate necessitates that  we capture the covariations of its three fundamental cycles.  Ecosystem productivity –  biomass accumulation and net Carbon exchange – is dependent on the evapotranspiration  flux and its determinants. Similarly the productivity of agroecosystems that feed humans   and their livestock depends on  this flux. Knowledge of this  flux, understanding its  determinants, and assessing its  vulnerability to climate change  are the rational bases for  managing human systems that  depend on the environment  and for charting a more  sustainable future.         Crosbie et al. ,Water Resour. Res (2013)     Considering that past climate changes have  significantly impacted groundwater resources,  quantitative predictions of climate change effects on  groundwater recharge maybe valuable for effective  management of future water resources.   Jasechko et al., Water Resources Research (2012)     …The reversal of current nonsustainable groundwater  extraction rates will require setting long-term pumping rate  goals that will achieve a balance with groundwater recharge and  ecosystem groundwater requirements. To determine sustainable  groundwater pumping rates requires accurate estimates of  groundwater recharge rates and thorough understanding of  seasonal controls upon recharge….       d) The science communities that would be involved.    Evapotranspiration and recharge are  fluxes across the critical zone and at the  interfaces of the Earth System cycles  including human systems. In order to  tackle the grand challenge of  understanding the past history, current  state and future prospects of these  fluxes, the science community from all  the linked cycles and systems need to  provide input.  The organization and  structure of the study needs to balance:  1) the formation of smaller groups and  panels that can make progress, and 2)  avoid the artificial division of the Earth System along historical science community  boundaries that is backward-looking.  The formation of panels along cycles ensures that  communities from all components of that cycle assemble together and discuss priorities.

Reager, Tom Farr, Jay Famiglietti (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,  Email: Donald.F.Argus@jpl.nasa.gov) What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  How are water resources in North America, Europe, and the Earth changing?  Are water changes sustained during periods of drought and heavy precipitation, and if so, how?  How fast are Earth's  groundwater basins being depleted?   Are water changes in each continent raising or lowering global sea level? Space observations are providing new, comprehensive information on changes in continental water, providing a fresh perspective on the analysis and application of conventional hydrologic measurements.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? Space measurements from GPS, InSAR, and GRACE are fundamental to answering these questions because they provide new, comprehensive information on total water changes and land subsidence generated by groundwater withdrawal.  GPS measurements of vertical and horizontal displacement of Earth's surface are being used to estimate changes in total water storage in the western U.S., in North America, and in Europe (where the network of GPS sites is dense).  Solid Earth's elastic response to a surface load is known and GPS vertical displacements have been rigorously inverted for changes in water load in the western U.S. each month at pixels 30 km apart (Argus et al. 2014, Borsa et al. 2014, Fu et al. 2015). We (Argus et al., ms. in prep.) have generated a time series of changes in the western U.S. from Jan 2006 through Sep 2015.  Changes in water storage are being found to be sustained over periods of either drought or heavy precipitation.   For example, GPS is providing a striking map of water change during the recent California drought from Oct 2011 to Oct 2014 (Fig. 1). GRACE gravity measurements have for 12 years been used to determine regional changes in ice, snow, and groundwater, thus providing new knowledge of changes in Earth's dynamic water resources.  Recent research by Richey, Famiglietti et al. (2015a,b) have applied GRACE’s unique observations to determine that 1/3 of Earth's primary groundwater aquifers are losing water at an unsustainable rate, highlighting the risk of eventual exhaustion. GRACE has also been applied to estimate how extremes in the amount of water present in a river basin help to define flood and drought conditions [e.g. Reager et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2014].  The unique ability of GRACE to measure changes in water beneath the land surface – where approximately 80% of hydrologic activity and runoff generation occurs – makes GRACE an extremely valuable tool to understand changing hydrological processes under changing climate conditions.  GRACE is also currently being applied to estimate hydrology contributions to sea level change, due to both human and natural drivers, on decadal intervals.  The GPS and GRACE data are complementary and are being simultaneously analyzed to separate changes in ice, snow, and water from solid Earth's viscous response to unloading of the ice-age ice sheets.  GPS measurements are being used to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE estimates of mass change, effectively sharpening the images of the GRACE maps.  ICE-6G (VM5a) [Argus et al. 2014, Peltier et al. 2015], the model of postglacial rebound fit to most available geologic and geodetic data, including about 2000 relative sea level histories from beach markers and coral reefs, is being used to correct GRACE estimates of change in ice, snow, and water for postglacial rebound. InSAR is showing southern Central Valley to be subsiding at spectacular rates of 50 mm/yr to 200 mm/yr due to groundwater being withdrawn from the aquifer.  InSAR measurements provide a comprehensive, high-resolution description of land subsidence.   We have generated a rough model of Central Valley groundwater loss by distributing the 3 km3 of total groundwater loss inferrred from GRACE across the areas measured with InSAR and GPS to be subsiding the fastest.  Integrating InSAR, GPS, GRACE, well water level data, and subsurface geologic information will improve our understanding of how the aquifer system responds to stresses induced by lowering water tables.  Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?  Existing and planned U.S. and international missions will advance the science described in this RFI.  There are more than 10,000 GPS sites throughout the world supported by U.S. and international programs.  GPS sites in the existing Plate Boundary Observatory in the western U.S. are nearly sufficient but must be kept active.  We advocate adding 25 new GPS sites in key locations in the Sierra Nevada and Colorado Plateau to further monitor water change.  GRACE, by NASA and GFZ, has been measuring Earth's gravity from 2002 through the present.  GRACE Follow-On is planned to start in 2017.  InSAR measurements of subsidence from Sentinel-1, by ESA, and from NISAR, by NASA and India, will provide a wealth of data on subsidence of Earth's surface in response to groundwater withdrawal. Technical advances in GPS, including those from an antenna in space with all four geodetic techniques (GRASP), will be used to more accurately determine vertical displacements and changes in continental water. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs; Measurements of groundwater loss from GRACE, continental water changes from GPS, and subsidence of Earth's surface from InSAR will provide state and national drought managers with comprehensive measurements can be readily compared to in situ measurements of precipitation, snowpack, soil moisture, and reservoir water levels. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and Estimates of change in water storage inferred from integrating GRACE, GPS, and InSAR must be communicated to national, state, and local water authorities for application to water resource management to strengthen impact.  Subsidence maps are already being used by water agencies to manage groundwater pumping and as early warnings of infrastructure damage. The science communities that would be involved.  A range of scientific communities will benefit from NASA space measurements, consisting of hydrologists, geophysicists, seismologists, and geodesists.  Distinguishing displacements generated by water changes from tectonic deformation will allow UNAVCO, SCEC, and NHERP scientists to better estimate earthquake strain accumulation and evaluate earthquake hazard.  Measurements of groundwater loss from GRACE, continental water changes from GPS, and subsidence of Earth's surface from InSAR will provide state and national drought managers with comprehensive measurements to complement conventional in situ data.  Integrating InSAR and GPS measurements to place comprehensive line of sight (and nearly vertical) displacements into an absolute reference frame fixed to Earth's mass center will allow city managers and constructional engineers to effectively evaluate urban infrastructure.  University scientists will have a wealth of new information to broaden scientific investigation into a range of natural and anthropogenic phenomena. Water loss in California  during drought  Oct 2011– Oct 2014  Fig. 1.  Water loss (in meters) during drought from October 2011 to October 2014 estimated from GPS vertical displacements using solid Earth's known response to a surface mass load.  An elastic model of water change in California's 20 largest reservoirs has been removed.  Groundwater loss in the southern Central Valley (gray outline) is constrained to be 9 km3 as estimated from GRACE [Famiglietti et al. 2011] and produces less than half of the observed uplift of the mountains during the drought.   Snow in California in October is insignificant.  Water loss therefore consists of soil moisture, surface water other than reservoirs, and mountain fracture groundwater.  Drought is interpreted to impact California's mountains. Water loss is distributed across a wide area in California's mountains.  Fig. 2.  Change in water storage in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River basin from 2006 to 2014 estimated from GPS (blue curve) is compared to that estimated from GRACE (maroon curve).  The effect of changes in reservoir storage, which are known from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), have been modeled and removed from the GPS data.  The CDEC data is then added to the GPS data (blue curve) for comparison against GRACE.  The GRACE estimate is from the JPL RL05M mascon solution [Watkins et al. 2015].  Total water change inferred from GPS is similar to that estimated from GRACE.  The GPS estimate does not include water change in snow, soil moisture, and groundwater in the Central Valley.  Since snow is negligible and changes in soil moisture are less than 6 km3 in the Central Valley, we can difference GRACE and GPS to infer groundwater loss in the Central Valley (green curve).  Groundwater loss in Central Valley inferred from GRACE minus GPS (green curve) is at a lower rate (–2 km3/yr) than that inferred from differencing GRACE and a composite hydrology model that represents all terms except for groundwater (violet curve).

Fire is the most important disturbance agent in the terrestrial biosphere.  In many regions, fire regimes have undergone rapid changes as a consequence of warming and increasing anthropogenic modification of ecosystems. Changes in fire behavior, occurrence, size, and severity have direct, critical impacts on the carbon cycle (emissions and productivity), the water cycle (evapotranspiration and runoff), ecosystem processes (composition, structure, and fluxes) and ecosystem services (air quality, water quality, and infrastructure). Using coarse (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS) and moderate (e.g. Landsat) spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery, we can currently observe where and when fires occur, and monitor coarse-scale ecosystem changes in response to fire disturbance. However, our ability to understand fire as an ecological process is limited by current measurement capabilities. To advance our knowledge of fire and its influence on the carbon and water cycles, ecosystems, and human systems, we must answer the following questions: - What are the total global carbon emissions from fires, accounting for spatial  variability in pre-fire fuel conditions and fire severity, and including emissions from   agricultural and understory forest fires? - How do fuel type, fuel condition, fuel moisture, and soil moisture influence fire  occurrence, behavior, and severity? - How do fire severity and intensity influence vegetation composition and carbon  sequestration during post-fire recovery? - How does fire alter ecosystem services of clean air and water, habitat, and biodiversity,  and which regions are most vulnerable to these changes? - How can we adaptively manage ecosystems to increase ecosystem resilience and  balance multiple ecosystem services?        1       Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to   readiness?  Ecosystems and fire regimes are rapidly changing at historically unprecedented rates. Wildfire activity has significantly increased in boreal forest ecosystems and declined in savannas. Agricultural fires are an increasing threat to sustainably managing tropical forests and peatlands. In many regions, fire is an important regulator of biodiversity, and recent changes in fire regime have caused permanent shifts in species composition. These ecological changes have implications for biodiversity, land use, carbon and water cycling, and Earth’s climate. Intensification of the fire regime in many areas contributes to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, while vegetation regrowth following fire can be a multi-decadal carbon sink. Billions of dollars are spent each year fighting and managing fires, meaning potential exists for selective fire management to target critical ecosystem services. Yet proper scientific understanding of fire impacts on ecosystems is lacking. It is urgent that we improve our understanding of fire processes and impacts while these rapid changes are occurring, enabling improved understanding of future ecosystem changes and providing science-based and data-driven information for improved resource management strategies and practices.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these   challenges/questions?  Global, space-based observations are essential to addressing the science questions listed above due to global diversity in fire processes. Fire occurs in ecosystems that range from tropical rainforests to deserts, and exhibits a variety of forms from canopy fires to long duration “ground” fires in organic soils.  Fire occurrence, fire behavior, fire severity, and subsequent vegetation recovery vary tremendously. Current understanding of fire processes through space-based observation has primarily relied on coarser spatial resolution (MODIS, VIIRS, GOES) and moderate spatial resolution (Landsat) multispectral observations covering visible, near infrared (NIR; 0.7-1.4µm), shortwave infrared (SWIR; 1.4-2.5µm), mid infrared (MIR; 3-5µm), and thermal infrared (TIR; 8-12µm) spectral regions. While valuable, these observations have limited capacity to: i) measure canopy water content or soil moisture, important indicators of fire danger; ii) identify fuel types  2        and vegetation functional types that help determine ecosystem recovery following wildfire and fire severity, behavior, and emissions; or iii) detect and measure temperature of low intensity and smaller fires that have critical impacts on carbon emissions and air quality. Current observing systems also have limitations for advancing our understanding of climate, weather, and fuel controls on fire behavior.  Imaging spectroscopy has demonstrated capabilities for characterizing fuel types, vegetation senescence, fire severity, and ecosystem recovery. Narrow spectral features in the SWIR spectral region allow detailed canopy moisture retrievals. Using seasonally acquired measurements of fuel moisture, the effects of pre-fire moisture conditions on fire behavior and fire severity can be evaluated. Imaging spectroscopy also permits sub-pixel fire severity assessments, allowing detailed discrimination between the green (live vegetation), brown (senescent or scorched vegetation), and black (charred vegetation) components of a post-fire landscape. For post-fire recovery, imaging spectroscopy can capture ecosystem composition during succession. Coupled with detailed information on pre-fire conditions and fire severity, this can add critical constraints to carbon cycle models and refine estimates of carbon emissions, post-fire carbon sequestration, and impact of changing fire regimes on the land carbon sink.  A space-based imaging spectrometer with a 30 m spatial resolution would provide continuity for global landscape-scale mapping, and the additional “bonus” of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI equivalent products created from finer spectral resolution data would facilitate broader Earth system science and application. A global mapping imaging spectrometer would be unique in its capabilities and coverage; the European PRISMA and EnMAP imaging spectrometers are sampling missions without global mapping capabilities. Multispectral SWIR, MIR, and TIR data are essential for detecting fires and measuring fire temperature. They can also be used to derive metrics of evapotranspiration and water stress, which can be indicative of fire risk and influence fire occurrence, severity and intensity. Current global mapping sensors (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS) do not have the spatial resolution or sensitivity required to detect many smoldering fires (lower temperature fires covering larger areas) and understory forest fires, and therefore our knowledge of their potential role in forest degradation and as an emission source is limited. High spatial resolution maps of fire temperature will allow improved estimates of combustion efficiency  3        and resultant carbon and particulate emissions. Mapping fires and their instantaneous emissions requires consistent global mapping at a spatial resolution of 60 m or finer, along with multiple bands to characterize fire temperature and for temperature-emissivity separation. A global mapping multispectral MIR/TIR sensor would be unique in its capabilities and coverage, since ASTER and ECOSTRESS multispectral TIR sensors are sampling missions, and all other TIR sensors have spatial resolutions coarser than 100 m. While current geostationary missions (GOES) offer advantageous temporal resolutions for studying fire behavior over time, their spatial resolution is far too coarse for this purpose. High spatial resolution SWIR and MIR spectrometers in geostationary orbit would improve our understanding of weather controls on fire behavior, and subsequent linkages with post-fire impacts on mortality and carbon losses. Metrics calculated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been related to in-situ biomass and organic soil moisture, an important consideration for fires in peatlands and forests where deep organic soils are the primary pools of carbon. Polarimetric SAR has shown value for estimating surface fuel moisture and quantifying vegetation biomass. There has not been a US polarimetric SAR system in orbit providing the data needed for a full exploration of polarimetric SAR for biomass and soil moisture retrieval, and future planned non-US SAR missions will not carry fully-polarimetric systems. Due to the multi-use nature of the future NISAR mission, full polarimetric image collection is planned for agricultural zones only and will not be collected in the most fire-prone regions.  While significant scientific advances in fire science are to be expected from the availability of one of these individual sensors, synergistic observation with multiple systems may further enable scientific discoveries. For example, canopy moisture content retrieved from imaging spectroscopy and water stress derived from TIR data provide complementary information with regards to fire risk. Combined observations could establish and quantify relationships between fuel type, fuel condition, canopy moisture content, soil moisture, and fire severity and ecosystem recovery. Monitoring surface soil moisture with SAR in conjunction with imaging spectroscopy would add to the information needed to model pre-fire fuel moisture status and post-fire ecological condition. Imaging spectroscopy, TIR, and SAR data could also complement missions to measure vegetation structure and continued monitoring and modeling of global vegetation productivity.    4        Measuring the critical impacts of fire on the carbon cycle, water cycle, ecosystem processes, and ecosystem services will require extensive collaboration across multiple disciplines within Earth System Science (e.g. terrestrial and fire ecology, biogeosciences, atmospheric chemistry and physics, geomorphology, hydrology). NASA has a long history of promoting successful applications related to fire activity and disturbance, and answering these questions will enable new applications that will benefit the fire and resource management communities. Improved understanding of fire processes will have direct societal benefits, including improved understanding of fire hazard and management of natural resources and ecosystem services.    5      ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"sander veraverbeke::margarita huesca::tatiana loboda::dar roberts::brendan rogers::amin tayyebi::jun wang::"}

Accurate inter-calibration of spaceborne Reflected Solar sensors is a key challenge  for Earth System Science  Calibration accuracy and consistency are the key on-orbit performance metrics for the Earth observing sensors and the system as a whole. The challenge is well recognized by the science community, both nationally and internationally. The accuracy and consistency of measure- ments across multiple spaceborne instruments in low Earth and geostationary orbits (LEO and GEO, respectively) are directly connected to the information content and scientific un- derstanding from observing complex systems such as Earth’s weather and climate. Recent results have demonstrated the quantitative impacts of observational accuracy on the science data products [Lyapustin et al., 2014] and the ability to detect climate change trends for several Essential Climate Variables – Earth radiation budget, cloud feedback, and long-term trends in cloud parameters [Wielicki et al., 2013; Shea et al., 2015].  a. Existing and planned U.S. and international programs: Several U.S. agen- cies – NASA, NOAA, and USGS – participate in inter-calibration efforts for LEO and GEO reflected solar sensors. Current activities rely on available assets such as referencing geo- stationary imagers to MODIS measurements, using lunar irradiance model predictions, and vicarious inter-calibrations using stable surface sites (e.g. Libyan desert, Dome C). The in- ternational inter-calibration effort is coordinated by the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS), with participation by U.S., European, and many other international satellite operators. The current state-of-the-art inter-calibration accuracy for reflected solar sensors is 3 – 5 % (k = 1)1 due to a lack of adequate on-orbit reference sources, sampling, and  1We use coverage factor k to establish a rigorous tie between the Earth Science and metrology communities. In the case of a Gaussian distribution, k = 1 is the same 68% confidence level as for 1σ [BIPM 2008].  1    NRC Decadal Survey 2017 – 2027 October 31, 2015  methodology in terms of calibration traceability. This accuracy is far from sufficient for a climate observing system [Wielicki et al., 2013]. Significant improvement of inter-calibration accuracy would extend geographical and temporal coverage far beyond the capabilities of an individual spacecraft to dozens of instruments already on-orbit. The following missions will have a significant impact on the inter-calibration quality by providing on-orbit reference standards:  (1) Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) will acquire accurate measurements of total and spectral solar irradiance (TSI and SSI, respectively). Both parameters are not only critical to understanding Earth energy budget and atmosphere response, but they will provide on-orbit reference for accurate calibration and inter-calibration of various sensors. The launch and deployment on the International Space Station (ISS) is scheduled for August 2017.  (2) Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) was recommended by the NRC Decadal Survey in 2007 [NRC, 2007] as a Tier-1 mission. The accurate inter- calibration of reflected solar sensors in LEO and GEO is a major and unique requirement for the CLARREO mission design – its reference accuracy is set to 0.15% (k = 1). Extensive stud- ies by the Science Team have demonstrated the feasibility of the CLARREO inter-calibration approach [Lukashin et al., 2013; Roithmayr et al., 2014; Wielicki et al. 2015]. Additionally, CLARREO will be able to characterize stable surface sites (e.g. Libyan desert, Dome C) with high accuracy, thus improving the ability for vicarious calibration. CLARREO passed MCR in November 2010, and is currently in pre-formulation with a high technology readiness level. In the FY16 President’s Budget request, the CLARREO Pathfinder is included as a demonstration mission on the ISS.  Both missions, TSIS (funded) and CLARREO (in pre-formulation), can provide the capa- bilities necessary to make substantial progress in establishing accurate inter-calibration for reflected solar sensors in LEO and GEO. Additional investments to establish the Moon as an on-orbit high-accuracy calibration source would enable even broader inter-calibration oppor- tunities as the lunar reflectance is practically invariable in time and can be directly measured by most Earth-observing instruments. Existing approaches to inter-calibrate spaceborne sen- sors against the Moon can achieve a stability of a tenth of a percent over 12 years [SeaWIFS; Eplee et al., 2012]. However, the current lunar calibration accuracy is limited to 5 – 10% (k = 1), depends on the photometric model of the Moon [Kieffer and Stone, 2005], and needs to be improved significantly. A new concept for a potential solution to this challenge is under development by a multi-agency and multi-center team with NASA Langley Research Center leading the effort:  (3) The ARCSTONE mission concept (under development), flying on a small satellite in LEO, will provide an orbiting spectrometer with accuracy sufficient to establish lunar spectral re- flectance as an SI-traceable absolute calibration standard for past, current, and future Earth’s weather and climate sensors.  b. Integration of space-based and other observations: Space-based accurate inter- calibration of reflected solar sensors should be integrated with airborne and surface observa- tions, providing validation of airborne and surface radiometric campaigns. Such integration can be achieved by near-coincident scheduled measurements from space, aircraft, and in-situ instrumentation. The implementation of multi-instrument data fusion requires the develop- ment and deployment of advanced frameworks capable of networking between relevant data centers [MIIC, Wielicki et al., 2015].  2    NRC Decadal Survey 2017 – 2027 October 31, 2015  c. Anticipated scientific and societal benefits:  Long Term Impacts: An improved high-accuracy Earth Observing System (EOS) will provide the data necessary to accelerate decisions on public policy concerning climate change by 15 to 20 years. Earlier and better informed decisions provide a large economic benefit to the U.S. and the world, estimated to be ∼$12 trillion over the next 40 to 60 years2 [Cooke et al., 2014]. By reducing the risk in climate prediction, an accurate EOS data will impact U.S. international policy, strategic planning by government agencies, operation and sustainment of key national assets, and risk assessment by the reinsurance industry.  Near Term Impacts: Establishing a high accuracy on-orbit inter-calibration standard for LEO and GEO sensors will reduce bias in the observations and geophysical parameters derived from them, improve consistency in land imaging constellations, and increase the accuracy of a wide variety of climate-relevant observations including land processes, atmospheric state variables, aerosols, and trace gases.  d. The science communities involved: The space-based inter-calibration of reflected solar sensors in LEO and GEO involves a large science community researching the fields of Earth’s radiation budget, ocean color, cloud and aerosol and atmospheric processes, land use and vegetation, and Earth’s climate.  2. Why is this challenge timely to address now ?  There are several arguments for the urgent implementation of accurate space-based inter- calibration of reflected solar sensors and improving the overall performance of the EOS:  (1) Growing societal importance of quantifying magnitude and rate of climate change. (2) Necessity of establishing highly accurate climate data records. (3) Previous investments into TSIS (scheduled) and CLARREO (in pre-formulation).  Delaying accuracy improvements of the climate observing system can result in additional adaptation/mitigation costs of hundreds of billions of dollars per year of delay [Cooke et al. 2014]. The technology to address this challenge exists and is ready.  3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing this challenge ?  Space-based observations are truly fundamental for enabling the accurate inter-calibration of reflected solar sensors as the concept requires measurements above Earth’s atmosphere to achieve global coverage, and to detect a wide variety of observed surface and atmosphere conditions (e.g cloud-free ocean/deserts/ice, deep convective clouds). To ensure sufficient inter-calibration sampling for multiple sensors in LEO and GEO, the inter-calibration reference source, such as CLARREO, has to fly in an optimized orbit – the current requirement is a 90◦ inclination polar orbit at 609 km altitude [Roithmayr et al., 2014; Wielicki et al., 2013]. To use the Moon as an accurate inter-calibration standard, it is essential to measure lunar reflectance from orbit to avoid large uncertainty in the absorption spectral regions, and the need for atmospheric corrections.  2Using the U.S. Interagency Memo of the Social Cost of Carbon (2010), highly accurate EOS value has been estimated at about $18 trillion for a 2.5% discount rate, $12 trillion for a 3% discount rate, or $3 trillion for a 5% discount rate.  3    NRC Decadal Survey 2017 – 2027 October 31, 2015  Selected References:  BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures), 2008: “Evaluation of measurement data – Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement,” Joint Committe for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), 120 pp.  Cooke, R.M., B.A. Wielicki, D.F.

Since the initial Earth Science and Application Decadal Survey (2007 DS), the Earth science community  has made progress toward integrating measurements and models in frameworks that begin to address  policy relevant questions in environmental management.  A key challenge for Earth system science in the  coming decade is to provide policy-relevant observations, integrated with modeling frameworks that  feature sufficient fidelity, to support environmental decision making for the future habitability of the  Earth.   The 2007 DS identified a “GEO-CAPE” mission with atmospheric composition objectives that strongly  reflect those of an earlier open community meeting held at NCAR (Edwards et al. 2006).  These objectives  were built upon the concept of an integrated observing strategy (based on surface, airborne and space- based observations of atmospheric composition) that had been established in 2004 through international  coordination by the intergovernmental group Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) in their  Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations (IGACO) report (Barrie et al. 2004).  The  integration of diverse observations is accomplished through modeling frameworks with data assimilation  with products that  can provide science based policy relevant information (e.g., Scovronick, et al., 2015).   The 2007 DS GEO-CAPE mission added methane observations to its mandate (Fishman, et. al., 2012 ) in  recognition of the changes in methane emissions over North America (Miller et al., 2013; Petron et al.,  2014) and co-benefits of reducing methane to both air quality and climate (West, et al., 2006; West, et al.,  2013).  Over a 20-year policy-relevant time frame, methane has a global warming potential of 86  compared to a reference of 1 for CO2 (IPCC 2013).  Lack of confidence in the available CH4 emissions  inventories (e.g., Miller et al. 2013) remains a problematic limitation to the design of efficient  environmental policies and to accomplishing the objectives set forth in the U.S. Strategy to Reduce  Methane Emissions (2014) and international policies.    From a larger climate perspective including plant damage, Avnery et al. (2015) examined potential  benefits of a tropospheric ozone (O3) mitigation strategy of gradual methane emission reductions since  methane is also a tropospheric O3 precursor that has not yet been targeted for O3 pollution abatement.   Climate and carbon cycle are tightly coupled on many timescales.  The IPCC states with high confidence  that climate driven changes of emissions from wetlands are the main drivers of the global inter-annual  variability of CH4 emissions. These emissions are highly sensitive to climate change and variability, as  shown, for instance, from the high CH4 growth rate in 2007–2008 that coincides with positive  precipitation and temperature anomalies (Dlugokencky et al., 2009).   Dense satellite observations of CH4 (multiple times per day at < 10 km spatial resolution) with attendant  tracers of atmospheric transport such as carbon monoxide (CO) (e.g., Wecht et al., 2014, Locatelli et al.,  2015) would support CH4 emissions estimates that are comprehensive, consistently measured,  accurate, and spatially attributed.   Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Existing NASA plans do not provide space-based observations of CH4 or necessary tracers in the coming  decade. However, the requirements for future CH4 observations that build upon proven capability and  provide the required improved spatial and temporal sampling needed for decision support are well       documented (Fishman et al., 2012).  Analysis of in situ CH4 measurements from NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ  suborbital mission demonstrated that real-world CH4 variability can be captured at spatial resolutions of a  few kilometers as evaluated for the 2007 DS GEO-CAPE. In addition, analysis using the NCAR  community WRF-CHEM modeling framework shows that discrimination between clean and polluted  profiles (3-5% enhancement in total column CH4 ) can be determined from such observations with 1%  precision for total column CH4 (Figure 1).   Figure 1.  Hourly space-based methane observations at better than 10 km spatial resolution can capture  the methane spatial variability and boundary layer enhancements observed during FRAPPE/DISCOVER– AQ in Colorado in 2014.  Left panel shows simulated space based observations; right panel provides  detailed in situ observations.   A broad atmospheric science community is engaged with the hypothetical GEO-CAPE observations and  has initiated development of new modeling capabilities that could support air quality and climate policy  needs for actionable information.  The modeling framework assembled through these studies includes  analytical tools for advanced chemical data simulation and assimilation, data analysis, and assessment (see  report at http://geo-cape.larc.nasa.gov/pdf/GEO-CAPE_2009-2015_SummativeWhitePaper.pdf).  This  framework is the basis for integrating future space-based observations with existing surface and airborne  observations.  Timmermans et al. (2015) describe Observing System Simulation Experiments to quantify  the value of new satellite observations of atmospheric constituents such as CH4.  The maturity of both  CH4 observation specifications and modeling frameworks to address air quality and climate policy needs  suggests that Decadal Survey investments in both models and measurements can pay dividends for  informed public decision making.   In addition to NASA’s modeling activities, the National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of  Energy sponsor chemistry-climate modeling work (e.g, Marsh et al., 2013; Amnuaylojaroen et al.,  2014,  Saide et al., 2014). The Community Earth System Model is a fully-coupled, community, global climate  model.  The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry simulates the  emission, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with       the meteorology.  The synthesis of observations with atmospheric chemistry models is central to progress,  with a focus on understanding and modeling fundamental processes.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges / questions?   The use of inverse models to estimate emissions relies fundamentally on dense data (e.g., Wecht et al.,  2014). Existing and planned ground based networks remain extremely sparse globally, and poorly  represent changing conditions in non-urban areas.  Without spatially and temporally dense data, the  modeling frameworks cannot produce products to support public decision making.   Quantitative estimates of air pollution emissions have been demonstrated using space based pollution  observations (e.g., Streets et al., 2013).  Alexe et al. (2015) demonstrated the value of existing space- based methane observations from SCIAMACHY and GOSAT to constrain methane emissions on a  spatial scale of hundreds of km and an annual temporal scale. However, such spatial and temporal  scales are inadequate to understand the relevant processes. There is considerable spatial overlap at  hundreds of kilometers between different CH4 source types (such as oil and gas, livestock, landfills);  finer spatial resolution is needed to separate individual sources. Methane emissions can also have very  large temporal variability, including “super-emitters” from oil/gas production and distribution systems  that are thought to contribute a large share of total emissions.  Thus, policy-relevant CH4 observations  would require substantial spatial and temporal resolution improvements over existing observing systems  where the sampling representation error greatly exceeds measurement errors.  The ESA TROPOMI  mission (expected launch 2016) offers approximately daily (but not hourly) methane observations with 7  km x 7 km spatial resolution.  There are no planned NASA space-based CH4  observations in the coming  decade.   Recent work by Bocquet et al. (2014) concluded the correction of emission biases may be an important  area of development and applications for coupled chemistry and meteorology models, in particular for  emission terms that carry large uncertainties.  Barré et al. 2015 conducted Observing System Simulation  Experiments (OSSEs) for time resolved observations of CO over USA, Europe and Asia using a  computationally economic scene-dependent observation simulator that accurately represented vertical  sensitivity (Worden et al., 2013).  This work captured near-surface pollution emissions in each region  around the globe and the importance of long-range transport between the regions that can be revealed  with vertically resolved CO.  (Note that that TEMPO will not provide vertically resolved CO.) NASA’s  investments in GEO-CAPE studies for over seven years have substantially advanced the necessary  analytical capabilities that could provide decision support when used with well-studied but not currently  planned space based observations of CH4  and related tracers.   In addition to spatially/temporally dense data from space, data-driven policy decisions require atmospheric  chemistry and transport models to provide products on relevant spatial scales, often urban.  Global models  with a typical resolution of a few hundreds of kilometers and regional chemical-transport models used at  resolutions of a few tens of kilometers, and their parameterization of physical and chemical processes,  make them inadequate for modeling air-quality at urban scale (Cohen et al., 2006).  Schaap et al. (2015)  demonstrate that improving the model resolution from 50 km between 10 and 20 km is computationally  practical and worthwhile.    A challenge for the decade ahead is to accelerate the combined use of policy-relevant data and advanced  atmospheric models to support air quality and climate decision making. Community model development  on finer scales would follow if decision support was prioritized. Current and planned space based assets  do not meet the observation needs for methane and related tracer data, but the requirements could be met  with mature observation capabilities that exist now.

Magee Professor of Geosciences and Geological  Engineering AOS Program, Princeton University   Chris Hostetler, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Langley Research  Center            31 October 2015             Key ESS question:  How will climate change over the coming century impact global  ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, resource sustainability, and human welfare?      Associated ESS challenge: Conduct global remote sensing observations, linked to  modeling and field measurements, that yield new insights on how the coupled Earth  System responds to contemporary climate variations, thereby enabling improved  predictions of future change that inform management and resource sustainability  decisions.    Decade of Discovery - This response to the Decadal Survey (DS) Request for Information (RFI)  focuses on global ocean observations.  Given that the DS committee charge is to recommend  observational requirements for the coming decade, it seems appropriate to ‘set the stage’ by briefly  recognizing some of the remote sensing achievements made over the past decade.    Since the 1970’s, the primary satellite tool available for globally observing ocean ecosystem  properties has been passive ocean color measurements.  With this technology alone, major progress  has been made in addressing the above ESS question and challenge.  We have discovered that ocean  phytoplankton are responsible for roughly half of the annual net primary production on Earth [1] and  that the globally-integrated response of the phytoplankton to climate variations can be notably stronger  than parallel changes in terrestrial plants [2].   In the last decade, it has been further shown that these  interannual changes in ocean chlorophyll are inversely related to sea surface temperature changes (i.e.,  a warming ocean exhibits decreased chlorophyll) [3].  Currently, these changes are driven primarily by  natural drivers of climate variability (i.g., El Nino Southern Ocean (ENSO) cycle, Pacific Decadal  Oscillation (PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) [4], but the relationship with SST  nevertheless provides invaluable insights on potential future climate change impacts.   Through the  development of ocean color inversion algorithms [5,6], we are now also able to distinguish changes in  phytoplankton biomass from changes in physiology [7].  With this new capability, ocean productivity  models have become more mechanistically based [8], our understanding of the inverse chlorophyll- SST relationship has been greatly advanced [9, 10], improvements have been made in assessing the  ocean biological carbon pump [11], and we have discovered that the largest annual plankton event in  the global ocean, the North Atlantic spring bloom, results from physical-ecosystem relationships that  are both very different than traditionally thought and directly impacted by climate [12,13].  Also in the  past decade, field studies have revealed unique physiological impacts of iron limitation in  phytoplankton that, in the equatorial Pacific alone, can cause errors in ocean productivity estimates on  the order of 2 Pg y-1 [14, 15].  Building from this finding, satellite chlorophyll fluorescence retrievals  by MODIS Aqua have allowed a global mapping of iron-limited plankton populations, including  previously unrecognized regions [16].  Fluorescence data from the Geostationary Ocean Color  Instrument (GOCI) have added to this understanding of phytoplankton physiological stressors [17].   These and many other ocean color-based discoveries over the past decade have greatly improved our  understanding of ecosystem functioning and have provided important constraints for coupled ocean  circulation – ecosystem models that allow improved predictions of future change.  With the launch of  NASA’s upcoming PACE mission, we can anticipate this record of discovery to continue.     DS‐Q1: What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum  of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?     New Era in Satellite Ocean Observations – Ever since the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS)  launched the modern satellite era of oceanography, fundamental limitations to this technology have  been recognized.  Specifically, the ocean color signal: (1) Emanates from only the first optical depth of  the ocean (exponentially weighted toward the surface) and thus provides no information on plankton  distributions over most of the photic zone, (2) Is not retrieved at low solar angles and under many  patchy cloud conditions, which particularly limits observations of the polar ecosystems that are  currently experiencing major impacts from climate change, and (3) Provides no information on  plankton ecosystems during night, which again limits our understanding of plankton annual cycles in  polar regions, as well as hinders new insights on global phytoplankton physiological conditions.       We are now in a position to address all of the above issues.  For decades, the utility of lidar  technology for vertically-resolving plankton properties has been demonstrated using airborne systems  [e.g., 18].  However, the applicability of this technology from space was untested until recently.  In  2006, NASA and the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) launched the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar  and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation  (CALIPSO) satellite as part of the A-train Earth  Observing Sensor suite [19]. The primary  instrument on CALIPSO is the Cloud-Aerosol  Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)  sensor, and it has reliably collected global lidar  measurements at 532 nm and 1064 nm for the past  9 years.  CALIOP was designed for atmospheric,  not ocean, applications and lacks the vertical  measurement resolution for plankton profiling.   Nevertheless, global distributions of phytoplankton  carbon biomass and total particulate carbon  stocks have been retrieved with CALIOP [20]  (Fig. 1).  Subsequent studies with CALIOP data  have confirmed this new capability and  demonstrate that we are ready for the next major step forward in the age of satellite oceanography.   Modifying the CALIOP approach to capitalize on the technologically-mature High-Spectral Resolution  Lidar (HSRL) technique, a new ocean-focused satellite lidar system is foreseeable in the immediate  future that could provide global active retrievals of plankton properties with subsurface vertical  profiling at 1 – 2 m resolution and down to 3 optical depths.   An HSRL-based ocean-profiling satellite lidar will allow more accurate quantification of  plankton stocks throughout the year in climate-sensitive polar regions (i.e., the measurements are  conducted both day and night) (Fig. 2), will improve global assessments of ocean productivity by  allowing characterization of phytoplankton biomass distributions within the subsurface light  environment, and will enhance our understanding of how ocean physical processes (mixing, advection,  etc) structure ocean ecosystems.  In addition, lidar measurements can retrieve plankton properties  under patchy cloud conditions that prevent ocean color observations, are not susceptible to the  significant atmospheric correction errors that ocean color data suffer from, and can be achieved to  aerosol/cloud optical thicknesses up to ~1.0.  Addition of fluorescence detection capabilities, which  have already been demonstrated for airborne lidar systems, would also allow active measurements of  phytoplankton physiological properties and an improved distinction of specific nutrient stressors.   Inclusion of a UV wavelength (355 nm) on an ocean lidar could also provide accurate assessments of  cDOM concentrations, which can then be used to refine ocean color inversion algorithms.     Figure 1.  The first global retrieval of ocean  particulate organic carbon concentrations  from  a space lidar [20]      A satellite lidar ocean profiling capability will allow major advances in addressing the ESS  question and challenge posed above, but will be particularly beneficial if coupled with the next- generation ocean color observations offered by the PACE sensor.  In this scenario, the ocean color   sensor provides information on spatial variability between lidar measurement lines.  In turn, the lidar  provides invaluable information on plankton vertical structure to complement the surface-only ocean  color signal and provides ocean retrievals under light or cloud conditions that compromise PACE  retrievals.  The lidar data would also enable advancements in ocean color inversion algorithms by  providing independent and active retrievals of ocean properties that are common to both sensors, such  as the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) and the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp ), from  which total particulate carbon and phytoplankton carbon stocks are assessed.  Furthermore, the lidar  would provide vertically-resolved atmospheric properties that can then be used to improve the  accuracy of atmospheric corrections for the ocean color sensor by providing information on total  atmospheric aerosol burdens, aerosol type, and aerosol vertical distributions.     The penetration depth for ocean lidar retrievals is limited by signal-to-noise to 3.0 optical  depths for an instrument of practical size and power.  Extending the characterization of plankton  vertical structure beyond these depths is nevertheless desirable.  This can be achieved through the  simultaneous development of a BioGeoChemical Argo float array (BGC-Argo), such that a global  distribution of profiling floats exists over the lifetime of the coupled lidar – next-generation ocean  color missions.  With this constellation of observing assets, the BGC-Argo array provides information  on deep-water plankton structure and biogeochemical properties (NO3, O2, pH) to extend the lidar  retrievals and science, albeit at a coarser spatial resolution than the lidar.  The combination of lidar and  BGC-Argo data together provide the vertical context to the ocean color retrievals, which in turn  provide the enhanced spatial coverage.  With this coordinated infrastructure, a global 3-dimensional  reconstruction of temporally-evolving ocean ecosystems can be envisioned that would yield profound  new insights on ocean biology, biogeochemistry, physical-biological interactions, and understanding  of future climate change impacts.     Figure 2.  High latitude coverage provided by CALIOP over a 16 day window in (left) January 2010 and  (right) June 2010.  Pink color = MODIS Aqua retrievals.  Dark blue = No MODIS data.  Light blue lines =  CALIOP measurements at aerosol/cloud optical depths < 1. The ability of CALIOP to make measurements  through cloud gaps and during darkness or low light has already yielded new insights on the early rise and  late demise of high-latitude plankton blooms and their link to ocean temperature changes.           The potential scientific advances that could be realized with a satellite-based ocean-profiling lidar have  been recognized for many years, but only within the past decade have the major developments been  made to demonstrate that this vision is now ready to become reality.  These developments include:     1. Launch of the CALIOP sensor and demonstration of global ocean plankton retrievals  2. Development of the HSRL technique and airborne demonstration of its advanced capabilities   for ocean retrievals and plankton profiling during 3 major field campaigns (Azores 2012,  SABOR 2014, NAAMES 2015)   3. Validation of CALIOP and airborne HSRL plankton retrievals through comparisons with direct  field measurements and MODIS Aqua matchups   4. CALIOP-based retrievals of complete annual plankton cycles for the Arctic and high-latitude  Southern Ocean, demonstrating successful retrieval of phytoplankton biomass during low-light  and polar night conditions and revealing new insights on phytoplankton losses and early bloom  initiation that are undetected by ocean color sensors.     In addition to these technological and scientific developments, raising an ocean profiling lidar sensor  to the status of a ‘top-tier mission’ DS recommendation is timely because:     1. Northern and Southern polar oceans are exhibiting some of the fastest rates of change in the  natural world, yet we currently do not observe these systems from space over extended periods  of each year   2. The two largest sources of errors in current ocean productivity estimates are uncertainties in  phytoplankton distributions within the upper 3 optical depths and incomplete knowledge of  phytoplankton physiological states.  Lidar observations can address these issues   3. Technological readiness of the HSRL approach is sufficiently high that a lidar mission could be  launched in the time frame of the upcoming PACE mission, with associated advantages of this  pairing described above   4. BGC-Argo arrays are already being developed and deployed around the world’s ocean that  could support a lidar mission (e.g., 200 floats from the NSF/NASA Southern Ocean Carbon  and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) program; float lifetime ~7 years)   5. An HSRL satellite lidar with the profiling capabilities described herein would have major  advantages for global cloud and aerosol sciences.  Some of these advantages are detailed in the  ‘ACE Mission’ whitepaper (lead: Dr. Arlindo da Silva) and the ‘Marine Aerosol-Cloud- Climate Interactions’ whitepaper (leads: Drs. Nicholas Meskhidze and Susannah Burrows) also  being submitted in response to the current DS RFI.    6. Mission studies are currently underway for a future HSRL mission with ocean profiling  capabilities at the NASA Langley Research Center and at CNES, with significant possibilities  for an interagency collaboration.                DS‐Q2: Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?             The ESS question and challenge posed above requires new satellite ocean observations (lidar)  coupled with advanced ocean color measurements (PACE).  Space-based observations are the most  effective tools for creating the globally-representative data sets needed for achieving new mechanistic  insights on Earth System functioning that inform advances in coupled global climate-ecosystem  modeling and improve predictions of future change. It is recommended here that for an evaluation of  the above ESS question and challenge the Decadal Survey committee assemble a science panel with  expertise in lidar technologies, ocean biogeochemistry, plankton ecology, ocean color remote sensing,  atmospheric aerosols, and clouds.      References   [1] Field, C.B., Behrenfeld, M.J., Randerson, J.T., Falkowski, P.G.

Jacob, Harvard University (djacob@fas.harvard.edu), AQAST leader November 1, 2015  Air quality management challenges in the US are evolving rapidly and increasingly convolved with concerns over biogeochemical cycles and climate change. The Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (AQAST) supported by the NASA Applied Sciences Program (ASP) has been working with US air quality managers since 2011 to maximize the utility of satellite data for air quality applications. Over this time we have built deep relationships with air quality agencies at national, state, and local levels. Many of these agencies are now extensively using satellite data for a variety of applications including improved emission estimates for state implementation plans (SIPs), mapping of particulate matter (PM) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), interstate and international transport, exceptional events, and long-term trends.  Air quality management needs in the US are evolving rapidly, in a direction that increases the importance of satellites for providing a comprehensive, sustained, large-scale perspective.  For example, the recent tightening of the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to 70 ppb raises the imperative to better quantify the ozone background and understand its origins. Emerging pressure to meet climate change mitigation targets is pushing air quality managers to include greenhouse gases in their regulatory process, and to look to satellite observations for understanding emissions. Fires and dust are an increasing air quality issue and satellites provide a unique viewing perspective. Growing interest in secondary standards to protect vegetation can be informed by an integrated view of atmospheric composition and ecosystem function from space. Anthropogenic emissions in the US are changing rapidly, and air quality managers are increasingly looking to satellites to quantify these changes as well as foreign emissions and transboundary transport. Climate and land-use changes are altering the physical atmosphere which then impacts emissions, boundary layer dilution, and other aspects of air quality. All satellite observations of atmospheric composition so far have been from low Earth orbit (LEO). They have shown significant value for constraining anthropogenic emissions, evaluating models, tracking fire and dust plumes, and documenting high-ozone episodes of background origin.  TROPOMI to be launched in mid-2016 will have 7x7 km2 nadir pixel resolution and daily revisit time. This is still short of a continuous view and (because of noise) will have limited value on a sub-monthly time scale. The TEMPO geostationary satellite mission for North America, selected in 2012 by the Earth Venture program and expected to launch in the 2018-2020 time frame, will revolutionize our ability to observe air quality from space. Its UV/Vis solar backscatter channels will provide hourly data at 2.5 x5 km2 resolution for aerosol optical depth (AOD), NO2, formaldehyde, SO2, and ozone. This will provide powerful new constraints to map emissions of ozone and PM precursors. Concurrent geostationary UV/Vis sensors will observe Europe and East Asia (the geostationary “constellation”).  But TEMPO has no IR channels and so will not be able to observe methane, CO, CO2, ammonia, or upper tropospheric ozone. It also has a design lifetime of just two years, which makes it more a demonstration than a program to support air quality management needs.  We make the case here that a UV/Vis/SWIR/TIR geostationary satellite mission for North America over the next decade is critical for addressing national air quality and climate management needs in a turbulent policy period where these needs are evolving rapidly. This satellite mission will provide a unique resource for the US and its neighbors (Canada and Mexico) to quantify emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases, to understand the contribution of pollution transported into and out of the North American domain, to measure regional radiative forcing, and to map surface concentrations of ozone and PM. Together with LEO observations to provide a global perspective, and with geostationary observations monitoring air quality and climate forcing in other parts of the world, it will contribute to a powerful space-based system for observing atmospheric composition and has been endorsed by the Atmospheric Science Working Group of the GEO-CAPE satellite mission.   1.What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Managing air quality and climate change together will be a critical national challenge for the US over the coming decade. A suite of new air quality issues is emerging including background ozone, wildfires, dust storms, nitrogen deposition, transboundary pollution transport, and emissions from oil/gas production. The current air quality observing system is not adapted to these issues. Satellite observations can play a critical role. Climate change mitigation will also become an important component of air quality management over the next decade, requiring accurate emission inventories for greenhouse gases (including biospheric uptake for CO2) and quantification of regional radiative forcing from aerosols and ozone.  Satellite observations will be key for evaluating the inventories and for enabling radiative forcing estimates. TEMPO will provide a first demonstration of geostationary observations of air quality for gases, and an expansion of geostationary observations for PM beyond GOES and GOES-R. It will provide unprecedented capability to map NOx and VOC emissions and to observe the distribution of ozone. But the short duration of TEMPO and the lack of IR channels is a serious limitation. There is a critical need for investment into a longer-term program of geostationary observations of air quality, including the capability to constrain national budgets of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane) and regional radiative forcing (aerosols, tropospheric ozone). The capability for doing all these measurements from LEO has been previously demonstrated. Doing them from geostationary orbit presents minor additional technical challenge but considerable additional reward. Geostationary observation of air quality and climate forcing over North America will need to be integrated into a broader observing system including LEO observations and suborbital platforms.The DISCOVER-AQ campaign has played an important role in developing a better understanding of how satellite observations can be effectively complemented by observations from aircraft, ground sites, and sondes. Ground-based lidars should also play an important role. A geostationary mission for air quality and climate forcing over North America will have major scientific benefits, for example through improved understanding of the carbon budget and its coupling with the nitrogen cycle.  It will enable detailed constraints on the methane budget by source type and allow detection of methane emission hotspots (the “superemitters”). The societal benefits will be considerable. The mission will provide the US and its neighbors with (1) an observing system to constrain national inventories of greenhouse gases, including short-term variability; (2) the capability to respond to mandates on mitigation of emissions causing climate forcing; (3) a tool for addressing changing demands of air quality management, (4) an improved initialization of air quality forecasts.  Multispectral geostationary observation of North America will engage not only atmospheric chemists and air quality managers but also climate scientists, policy analysts, terrestrial ecologists, and land-use managers.   2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Air quality and climate forcing will be pressing national issues over the next decade.  Quantifying emissions of greenhouse gases and the contributions from different sources will be a challenge of considerable importance for climate policy, as reflected by the Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) program presently led by NASA. Observations from geostationary orbit will provide unprecedented capability for addressing these issues.  A long-term geostationary mission covering the UV/Vis/SWIR/TIR multispectral range is required for targeting air quality and climate forcing objectives in a synergistic manner. Such measurements could be obtained from a new mission covering this full multispectral range or perhaps by extending the TEMPO mission and complementing it with the required SWIR/TIR measurements.  3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Geostationary space-based observations provide a continuous fine-grained mapping of atmospheric concentrations that is fundamental for addressing air quality and climate forcing issues.  The value of satellite observations of atmospheric composition to constrain emissions through inverse modeling has been amply demonstrated over the past decade. Geostationary observations will revolutionize our ability to constrain emissions from space including daily variability on km scales. This will provide an essential complement to bottom-up inventories and allow continual testing of these inventories in terms of changing emissions and the contributions from different source types. Space-based observations from geostationary orbit will support the enforcement of air quality standards and the conduct of epidemiological studies for air quality. For example, the Intermountain West will likely fail to meet the new ozone NAAQS because of elevated background ozone, new emissions from oil/gas production, and increasing frequency of wildfires. Surface monitors in that region are sparse. Geostationary observations will provide complete coverage including the information on contributions from the ozone background and local emissions. Epidemiological studies of the health effects of PM have been limited by the poor geographical coverage of PM surface observations. Geostationary observations will provide the fine spatial granularity needed for these studies.   ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":""}

NASA based  missions such as Aqua (AMSR-E, MODIS and AIRS sensors), CloudSat (CPR sensor) and TRMM (TMI,  PR and LIS sensors) and most recently, GPM (GMI and DPR sensors) have advanced our  understanding about surface properties, atmospheric temperature and moisture distribution, cloud  properties and three-dimensional precipitation characteristics.  (At the time of this writing, SMAP  radiometer measurements are just emerging). In some instances, these missions have served as risk  reduction for many of the current/upcoming operational sensors flying on NOAA and EUMETSAT  satellites (e.g., MODIS for VIIRS; AIRS for IASI; LIS for GLM).  Although a tremendous amount of  scientific insight has been gained from each of these missions, difficulties remain in co-registering all  of these measurements (in both time and space) to get a robust integrated, easy to use scientific  data set. In some sense, this has limited their potential value since no, comprehensive program or  science team has been focused on such an endeavor.  This is not a criticism of these highly  successful missions, but more of a reality in terms of how these missions are conceived, developed,  launched and then exploited by the community.  As we move forward, the next logical step is to  develop a dedicated mission that can simultaneously measure several aspects of the water cycle  which will continue to help us learn more about these synergistic physical processes and be  managed (both scientifically and data wise) in a more efficient manner.  Such a concept has also  been recognized by several international satellite observing programs, including GEO, CEOS and  CGMS.  Furthermore, fusing the satellite data with high quality surface observations has been  gaining momentum and should be a priority of any future satellite program.    “Total Water” is an increasingly high priority item at NOAA; the National Water Center (NWC) in  Tuscaloosa, AL is just one component of NOAA’s focus to be able to improve its monitoring and  prediction of water quantity and quality.  NWC is a joint activity between NOAA, USGS, FEMA and  the Army Corp of Engineers.  NOAA’s primary satellite missions – JPSS and GOES-R – are the  backbone of global water monitoring, primarily for water vapor, clouds and precipitation.  They  supplement ground observations (in particular, over the United States) but offer greater spatial  coverage where the ground observations are scarce or of limited quality (i.e., mountainous regions,  sparse populated areas and off shore locations).  The derived satellite products themselves,  especially when combined (i.e., merged IR and microwave, as well as radar and rain gauge), serve  NOAA’s forecasting and climate needs.  In addition, the radiances from the satellite observations are  critical input for operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.  The new instruments on  these satellites will improve NWP forecasts; however, challenges remain in terms of data  assimilation, especially in cloudy and precipitating atmospheres.  For NWP community, advances can  be made through improved physical understanding of the water vapor, cloud and precipitation  processes, and their coupling to surface moisture.  Improving land surface process and radiative  transfer models will come about with a better understanding gained from remotely sensed  observations.  For this assortment of reasons, the need for an advanced, end to end water observing  system from space is desired, and is a topic ripe for NASA to pursue in its future earth observations.       A vision for such a mission could be based on the CloudSat, GPM and SMAP heritage.  If  technologically feasible, radar that would have the combined capabilities of the GPM DPR and  CloudSat CPR would potentially yield the sensitivity to obtain cloud particle distributions and  precipitation characteristics, including both solid and liquid forms.  Additionally, adding in a vertical  Doppler capability would enhance information regarding particle shape and size.  Furthermore,  adding in a SMAP-type radar and/or a shorter wavelength synthetic aperture radar would also be  beneficial.  These instruments would be useful in the retrieval of near-surface soil moisture, surface  water depth and extent, and freeze/thaw information which would provide surface “memory” of  precipitation that fell during times where the satellite measurements were unavailable. A  microwave radiometer that spans the frequency ranges of the GPM GMI and SMAP radiometer  would provide both the surface and atmospheric information required to monitor atmospheric  water vapor, clouds, precipitation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture, and land surface  characteristics.  Additionally, extension of the radiometer to L-band would also provide information  on salinity over the oceans that could help determine fresh water fluxes.  And finally, a MODIS class  visible/IR sensor would further help in providing cloud information.  Enhanced sensors with some of  these attributes are being pursued/considered by several research and operational agencies in  Japan, China and Europe.      In order for operational agencies like NOAA to further exploit such measurements beyond the basic  science understanding anticipated from such a mission, a challenge posed to NASA would be to  develop the proper synergistic measurements from this wide array of sensors (i.e., co-registered in  time and space, including across as much of the orbital swath as possible), manage the observations  in a way that can be easily exploited, and then to make them available with relatively low data  latency.  So besides the basic engineering challenges for such a mission, a further obstacle that  needs to be part of the mission requirements is to put the level 1 radiances from all sensors in an  innovative, co-registered form with low latency comparable to operational weather satellites that  are exploitable by both the scientific and operational communities.    It is envisioned that this new mission would “anchor” a global “virtual constellation” of both  research and operational missions, with the research mission providing detailed measurement to  focus on the physical processes and develop the “science” that can then be exploited on the  operational missions; this would include sensor risk reduction activities that can then feed into  future operational sensors.  In some sense, the GPM model would be followed, but would consider  satellites/sensors related to all of the water cycle and not just to precipitation alone.

The workshop,  organized and managed by Dr’s. Forrest Hall (NASA GSFC) and Scott Goetz (WHRC),  involved 50 scientists from institutions and agencies including NASA, USGS, USFS,  NSF, NOAA and DOE engaged in terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, land use and land  cover change, and biodiversity (TECLUB) research.  A draft report was posted online for  comment by a wider community and the comments were addressed in a final report  (http://cce.nasa.gov/cce/pdfs/TECLUB_Final_Report.pdf) from which this summary is drawn.    Key   challenges/questions   for   Earth   System   Science   in   the   coming   decade    Rapid changes in climate and ecosystems are driving the concerns of policy makers, as  important societal functions become increasingly impacted. Climate change, carbon  management, biodiversity protection, food security and other key issues require policy  and science knowledge to address key unanswered questions of societal relevance.  TECLUB measurement priorities address four key questions:   1. How long can Earth’s ecosystems sustain their functions as they are modified by climate  and human activities?     2. How will water and food security be affected as climate changes and human consumption  intensifies; how will they respond to various policies aimed at adapting to and mitigating  these effects?   3. What are the consequences of significant changes to existing ecosystem services?  Terrestrial and marine ecosystems influence the rate of climate change, currently  absorbing half of fossil fuel emissions. Which terrestrial ecosystems are most responsible  for this mitigation, and by how much? How are climate and anthropogenic changes  affecting their ability to sequester carbon?      4. Biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability are changing as a result of human alterations to  the landscape. What are the consequences for human well-being?   Data   Requirements   and   Research   Needs    To address these scientific questions, the science community must quantify the state and  dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems at finer temporal and spatial scales. The TECLUB  priority needs address (1) continuity in the current observational data and capabilities, (2)  improved temporal frequency, and spectral and spatial resolution of remote sensing  observations, and (3) new kinds of observations already available but leveraging current  technologies and approaches.   The identified measurements require both the continuation  of existing assets, as well as new measurements using technologies developed in the past  decade.    In addition to global data needs, regional studies are needed to address uncertainties in  global observations and improve models for better understanding of underlying     mechanisms.  These requirements can be addressed with sub-orbital missions and  targeted orbital observations coupled with in situ measurements to (a) permit policy  makers to assess and mitigate regional impacts in arctic, boreal, temperate and tropical  ecosystems and (b) assess and validate remote sensing algorithms and analysis  frameworks needed to generate the required information.     Global   Observations:   Space-­‐based   observations   to   address   key   scientific   questions   and    societal   needs     Only global, periodic, long-term, spatially contiguous data series can satisfy global policy  information needs to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate and land use change  on human societies, agricultural security, and biological diversity.      The first global measurement priority for all disciplines emerging from the workshop  was to increase the observational frequency of the legacy 30m spatial resolution data to  acquire ~weekly observations.   Weekly cloud free observations will permit finer temporal scale resolution of vegetation  composition, vegetation function and condition. These data were identified as essential to  enable detection, quantification and characterization of rapidly changing land use  patterns. Frequent, repeat, moderate resolution data were also identified as important for  characterizing phenology, taxonomic diversity, and their dynamics in persistently cloudy  areas.  Frequent data are essential to link modeling results to continuously operating flux  measurements. Cloud-free, spatially explicit spectral observations at ~weekly intervals  require a 3 to 4 day repeat overpass, particularly in regions with high cloud cover.     Higher temporal resolution would also enable improved vegetation structure, function  and dynamics information by exploiting multi-date phenology information and much- improved landcover type discrimination (particularly for global agricultural monitoring).   Adding capacity to acquire selected high spectral resolution data would provide essential  information on vegetation condition (i.e. structure, function and health) at critical time  steps.  In all disciplines better coordination between US, European, Japanese, Brazilian  and other satellites, sensors and data products are needed to improve the spatial and  temporal resolution of land change dynamics, in continuity with the 40-year Landsat  record.    The second priority measurement need identified by all discipline groups was the  missing vertical dimension of vegetation structure.   It is critical to add vertical information to the two-dimensional maps of vegetation  community composition.  At a minimum, annual measurements of three-dimensional  vegetation structure at meter-scale horizontal resolution and sub-meter vertical resolution  are required to enable enhanced characterization and quantification of LULCC, and to  quantify forest biomass for global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystem studies, as well  as habitat for better understanding patterns of biodiversity, habitat use and conservation  efforts.        The third global priority was quantification of primary productivity and agricultural  yields of food and fiber through improved global measurements of vegetation and  biogeochemical composition, function, and photosynthetic capacity and rates.     This priority could be satisfied by augmenting the Landsat and Sentinal2 multispectral  imagery with an additional satellite carrying an imaging spectrometer with appropriately  selected narrow spectral bands spanning the vegetation chlorophyll-a to thermal spectral  domains. The additional bands are desired to quantify the biochemical status of  vegetation, photosynthetic capacity and rates of surface-atmosphere carbon, water and  energy exchange. A full spectrum imager would provide additional spectral flexibility.   Trade studies to quantify the added value of full spectrum imaging over selected narrow- band imagers in terms of their relative operational complexity, data handling and cost  will be needed to determine best approaches.    Measurement requirements associated with each of these priorities are summarized in  Table 2 of the full TECLUB report.     Regional   Observations    The top TECLUB priorities for regional data are high-resolution imagery for  validating and understanding medium resolution measurements of land use change  and ecosystem function, and accurate, dense atmospheric carbon concentration  measurements particularly in the tropics and the arctic.    The report called for dense regional measurements in key regions, which is strongly  echoed by other recent reports (CEOS 2014; Moore et al. 2015). Some of these  requirements will be met via programs like the DOE’s Next Generation Ecosystem  Experiments, the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, and projects under NASA’s  Earth Venture class of missions. In the next decade these and additional work and science  are needed.   Models that use global data must be improved and validated at high resolution, best  accomplished at regional scales. Interdisciplinary work that links human, social, and  environmental observations across scales also will benefit from high spatial and temporal  resolution regional observations complementing global observations.     Links   with   existing   and   planned   U.S.   and   international   programs    It is important to note the TECLUB participants identified measurement needs  independently of planned remote sensing technology from U.S. and international  partners. For example, the first priority measurement need for more frequent acquisitions  recognizes this may be partially addressed via planned missions.     As TECLUB measurements priorities are met by new international missions (e.g.  Sentinel2, Landsat8, GEDI, IceSat2, NI-SAR, BIOMASS, etc), priorities should be  adjusted to accommodate unfilled measurement needs.    What   additional   investments   are   needed?    Satellite monitoring of the terrestrial carbon cycle is a missing key to achieve scientific  understanding of climate feedbacks and realistic prediction of climate scenarios. To date,     these feedbacks are the single most critical factor limiting the accuracy of those  predictions. This lack of spatially and temporally comprehensive information results in  large model uncertainties (about ±40%).     Using selected narrow spectral band imagers or full spectrum imaging (spectroscopy) can  provide critical additional information to quantify the components of gross primary  production (PAR, Fpar and Light Use Efficiency) and related fluorescence emissions.  Multi-angle narrow spectral imaging of the landscape adds information for estimating  these variables. To reduce uncertainties, a synergistic measurement framework is needed  with specific data requirements across spatial scales.   Anticipated   scientific   and   societal   benefits    The Group on Earth Observation identified nine societal benefit areas including:  disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and  biodiversity. The previous NRC2007 report identified three science themes: disruption of  carbon, water and nitrogen cycles; changing land and marine resource use; and changes  in disturbance cycles. Most recently, Working Group3 of the IPCC-AR5 identified four  key “knowledge gaps” including: improved global high resolution crop production data,  globally standardized and homogenized data on soil and forest degradation, improved  understanding of land-based climate mitigation options, and better understanding the  effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. In  2010, Congress directed NASA to develop a prototype Carbon Monitoring System to  provide data products required by carbon trading protocols and national-scale reporting  and monitoring efforts. The TECLUB effort was conducted with this background and  context.   Science   communities   involved    The research communities involved in TECLUB represent a broad spectrum of scientists  listed in the report posted online (http://cce.nasa.gov/cce/pdfs/TECLUB_Final_Report.pdf).  Many of the participants were involved in related efforts (IPCC AR5, GEO, CEOS, and  the prior NRC Decadal Survey).

fundamental   metric   of   climate   change   has   been   elusive   since   the   first   IPCC   35    assessment.   The   values   produced   by   the   leading   models   of   the   1990’s   ranged   36    between   1.5   and   5   degrees.      Now   after   the   fifth   assessment   report,   the   range   in   37    predicted   climate   sensitivity   remains   between   2   and   5   degrees.      What   has   become   38    clear,   however,   is   that   one   major   cause   of   this   spread   in   predicted   climate   sensitivity   39    is   the   manner   in   which   marine   boundary   layer   (MBL)   clouds   change   in   a   warmer   40    world.      Models   predicting   little   change   in   MBL   clouds   under   a   warmer   climate   41    exhibit   low   sensitivity,   in   contrast   to   models   predicting   decreases   in   MBL   clouds   42    that   have   a   high   sensitivity.      Other   sources   of   climate   sensitivity   uncertainty   are   43    linked   to   inadequate   representations   of   ice   and   mixed-­‐phase   cloud   microphysics   44    and   transitions   of   cloud   thermodynamic   phase.   As   long   as   the   question   regarding   45       cloud   feedback   remains   open,   so   will   the   climate   sensitivity   question,   and   our   ability   46    to   inform   policy   makers   about   Earth’s   climate   over   this   and   the   next   century   will   47    remain   compromised.   Putting   it   simply,   Earth’s   climate   sensitivity   cannot   be   48    determined   without   first   solving   the   problems   associated   with   MBL   and   other   49    clouds.            50       51    Changes   to   MBL   clouds   in   a   warming   world   have   been   difficult   to   predict   because   52    their   macroscale   characteristics   such   as   cloud   cover   that   evolves   as   global   53    temperatures   rise   are   largely   due   to   changes   in   MBL   dynamics   driven   by   changes   in   54    the   cloud   fields   themselves.      These   cloud   fields   are   at   once   composed   of   myriad   55    evolving   cloud   elements   going   through   their   individual   lifecycles   in   10’s   of   minutes   56    in   response   to   local   dynamical   and   thermodynamical   forcings.   The   forcings   in   turn   57    depend   on   how   past   cloud   elements   evolved   and   modified   their   environment   58    through   various   processes   such   as   mixing   dry   air   from   the   free   troposphere   and   59    downdrafts   in   precipitation.   A   foundational   concern   in   this   process   is   the   number   of   60    cloud   droplets   nucleated   in   an   updraft   because   droplet   concentration   affects   the   61    timing   of   precipitation   onset   and   the   vertical   development   of   a   cloud.   These   62    processes   determines   how   a   cloud   element   modifies   the   local   thermodynamic   and   63    dynamic   environment   by   mixing   rain-­‐cooled   or   dry   air   from   the   free   troposphere   64    into   the   marine   boundary   layer   that   subsequently   drives   the   next   sequence   of   cloud   65    elements.            66       67    It   has   been   known   for   nearly   4   decades   that   the   characteristics   of   the   aerosol   68    particles   (their   number,   size   distributions   and   chemical   properties)   largely   69    determine   the   number   of   droplets   nucleated   in   an   updraft   of   a   given   strength.      If   the   70    aerosol   concentrations   are   increased   due   either   to   natural   or   anthropogenic   71    mechanisms,   the   cloud   field   and   in   particular   the   droplet   size   distribution,   responds   72    in   a   way   that   results   in   deeper   and   more   reflective   cloud   elements   that   also   take   73    longer   to   rain   because   of   more   numerous   and   smaller   droplets.      It   is   unknown   74    whether   these   microphysical   perturbations   persist   or   whether   the   cloud   field   75    adjusts   via   dynamical   feedbacks   as   suggested   by   recent   studies.      The   manner   in   76    which   the   cloud   field   evolves   over   time   (due   to   specific   aerosol   forcings   within   77    certain   dynamic   and   thermodynamic   environments)   can   be   simulated   with   high-­‐78    resolution   models,   and   parameterizations,   in   theory,   can   be   formulated   from   such   79    simulations.      However,   and   this   is   the   key   issue,   the   accuracy   of   such   predictions   and   80    the   fidelity   of   resulting   parameterizations   are   unknown   because   observations   do   not   81    exist   to   constrain   the   predictions.      Even   though   the   dynamical   feedbacks   are   critical   82    to   our   ability   to   simulate   the   MBL,   the   important   constraints   that   lend   themselves   to   83    measurements   are   aerosol,   cloud,   and   precipitation   microphysics.      Ultimately,   data   84    assimilation   and   modeling   will   need   to   go   hand-­‐in-­‐hand   with   the   advanced   85    measurements,   bridging   these   coupled   processes.      86       87    Beyond   the   MBL   cloud   problem,   the   fifth   IPCC   assessment   report   stressed   that   the   88    representation   of   aerosol–cloud   interactions   in   mixed-­‐phase   and   ice   clouds   is   even   89    less   advanced   than   in   liquid-­‐only   clouds.   With   thermodynamic   phase   affecting   cloud   90    opacity,   evolution   and   precipitation   characteristics,   the   poor   understanding   of   the   91       climatology   and   lifecycle   of   aerosol   particles   that   can   serve   as   ice   nuclei   is   a   glaring   92    shortcoming.      93    Therefore,   a   prerequisite   of   accurately   predicting   climate   sensitivity   are   observations   94    that   constrain   the   aerosol   characteristics   in   the   MBL,   observations   that   constrain   the   95    updraft   velocity   at   the   base   of   MBL   clouds,   and   a   strategy   to   observationally   96    characterize   the   number   of   cloud   droplets   that   are   nucleated   at   the   base   of   MBL   97    clouds,   and   for   inferring   the   production   of   and   characteristics   of   precipitation   as   a   98    function   of   height   in   MBL   clouds.      Furthermore,   improved   constraints   on   aerosol   size   99    distributions   and   composition,   cloud   phase,   ice   microphysics   and   cold   cloud   100    precipitation   are   crucial   to   further   reduce   uncertainties   associated   with   mixed-­‐phase   101    and   ice   clouds.   We   maintain   that   an   observing   system   designed   to   retrieve   these   102    geophysical   parameters   must   be   an   explicit   goal   of   the   succession   of   missions   103    planned   for   the   next   decade.   These   measurements   hold   the   key   for   predicting   the   104    Earth’s   climate   sensitivity   with   reasonable   confidence.            105       106    In   short,   our   inability   to   observationally   constrain   global   aerosol   size   and   107    composition,   cloud   phase   and   ice   and   liquid   microphysics   severely   limits   108    advancement   on   nearly   all   issues   related   to   reducing   the   intermodel   spread   in   109    climate   sensitivity.      110    Many   of   the   above   points   were   also   made   in   a   whitepaper   that   emerged   from   a   111    community   workshop   held   at   NASA   Ames   Research   Center   in   May   of   2014.      The   112    document   entitled   “Outstanding   Questions   in   Atmospheric   Composition,   Chemistry,   113    Dynamics,   and   Radiation   for   the   Coming   Decade”,   (available   114    at    https://espo.nasa.gov/home/content/NASA_SMD_Workshop),   identifies   a   115    number   of   critical   science   questions   to   be   addressed   for   our   understanding   of   the   116    Earth   system   to   improve.      Among   these,   the   aerosol,   cloud,   radiation,   and   convection   117    sections   of   the   document   generally   agree   that   the   understanding   of   aerosol,   cloud,   118    and   precipitation   processes   within   various   circulation   regimes   represents   our   119    greatest   challenge,   and   only   observationally   constraining   those   processes   will   bring   120    improved   understanding.         121       122    2. Why   are   these   challenges/questions   timely   to   address   now   123     especially   with   respect   to   readiness?      124       125    Observationally   constraining   aerosol   cloud   interaction   as   described   above   is   both   126    more   necessary   and   also   more   practically   attainable   now   for   a   confluence   of   127    reasons.      Computing   power   has   led   to   rapid   advances   in   simulations   of   aerosol-­‐128    cloud-­‐precipitation   processes.      Global   model   runs   are   now   possible   at   the   cloud   129    resolving   scale,   while   large   eddy   simulations   of   cloud   systems   are   feasible   at   grid   130    spacings   of   a   few   meters.      Measurement   systems   must   keep   pace   with   these   131    capabilities.      But   the   opposite   is   actually   happening,   with   our   measurement   132    capabilities   from   space   contracting   as   the   A-­‐Train   begins   disbanding   in   the   2017   133    timeframe,   and   no   next   generation   suite   of   observing   systems   meeting   the   134       requirements   identified   above   and   keeping   pace   with   the   modeling   community   is   135    being   readied   for   launch.      136       137    The   2007   NRC   Decadal   Survey   had   recognized   the   observational   needs   identified   138    here   and   recommended   the   Aerosol-­‐Clouds-­‐Ecosystem   (ACE)   Mission.      ACE   as   139    presently   envisioned   in   a   recently   completed   whitepaper   would   be   capable   of   140    addressing   the   observational   constraints   necessary   to   resolve   cloud-­‐aerosol   141    interactions.   NASA   has   continued   to   invest   in   rapidly   maturing   ACE-­‐related   142    technology   to   the   point   where   an   advanced   suite   of   measurements   would   be   much   143    more   capable   than   the   A-­‐Train   or   the   European   equivalent   EarthCare   slated   to   144    launch   in   2018.         145       146    Therefore,   the   conjunction   of   advances   in   modeling   capabilities   and   measurement   147    technology   make   solving   the   aerosol-­‐cloud   problem   for   MBL   and   other   types   of   148    clouds   an   attainable   possibility   in   the   coming   decade.   149       150    3. Why   are   space-­‐based   observations   fundamental   to   addressing   151     these   challenges/questions?   152       153    It   is   reasonable   to   ask   whether   global   measurements   are   needed   to   constrain   154    microphysical   processes.      Why,   for   instance,   cannot   suborbital   or   even   ground-­‐155    based   measurements   suffice?      The   issue   is   one   of   statistical   robustness   and   156    accessibility.      Often   multiple   processes   compete   or   work   in   tandem   and   resolving   157    process-­‐level   information   from   remote   sensing   measurements   be   they   suborbital   or   158    space-­‐based   is   challenging   because   poor   spatiotemporal   coverage   limits   contextual   159    information.      Therefore,   only   a   global   set   of   measurements   collected   over   a   period   of   160    years   will   allow   us   to   develop   the   relevant   statistics   over   diverse   meteorological   161    regimes   and   aerosol   types,   including   the   most   distant   regions   of   the   planet   where   162    aircraft   and   ground-­‐based   assets   are   nearly   impossible   to   deploy.      While   aircraft   and   163    ground   observations   for   judicially-­‐selected   case   studies   will   still   be   useful   and   even   164    necessary   for   providing   evaluation   and   validation   of   space-­‐based   estimates,   and   165    additional   statistical   constraints,   only   global   measurements   are   capable   of   collecting   166    the   data   volumes   required   to   understand   aerosol-­‐cloud   processes   as   a   function   of   167    circulation   regime.         168       169       170      ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"richard ferrare::graham feingold::brian cairns::roger marchand::michael garay::david diner::david winker::"}

Two key elements of the connection—the impacts of  water stress on ecosystem production and the impacts of ecosystem production on water  availability—must be addressed through joint measurements of photosynthetic  productivity and hydrological states and fluxes.  Such measurements and associated  analyses would have direct bearing on such issues as food and water security (particularly  relevant in the context of growing populations), consumptive water use, and drought  monitoring and forecasting.   1.1 Need for space-based observations  To monitor, understand and predict changes in regional patterns of vegetation stress and  water availability at decision-relevant scales, our existing and planned networks of flux  towers and in situ soil moisture measurements are inadequate. While certain countries or  states have invested in soil moisture and flux networks, these are either absent or  prohibitively sparse in the most food- and water-insecure regions of the world, such as  East Africa.  Therefore, space-based observations offer the best vantage point for  monitoring indicators of water use and water stress.   1.2 Timeliness  The last ten years have seen substantial progress in both instrument technology and  retrieval algorithms required for measuring vegetation stress and water availability.   Laboratory studies and satellite measurements (GOSAT, GOME-2, OCO-2) have     2   demonstrated that solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and other reflective indices are  indicative of photosynthetic rate or efficiency (and its limitation by stress).   Evapotranspiration (ET) is now commonly estimated using energy-balance models that  rely on satellite-derived surface temperature (via thermal infrared radiometer, or TIR,  data) as an input, and a variety of newer detector options (microbolometers, strained  superlattice arrays) now exist for TIR observations.  New research shows that ET models  can also be driven using surface temperature from microwave Ka band data, providing  all-weather coverage.  Finally, soil moisture can be retrieved using low frequency  microwave data, as demonstrated by NASA’s SMAP and ESA’s SMOS missions.      1.3 Key Science questions  • Where, globally, does water availability currently limit ecosystem productivity   (including the potential for crop production)?  How and why might these water  limited areas change with changing climate, population and land-use?   • Where do variations in ecosystem productivity currently modify water  availability?  How and why might these energy limited areas change with  changing climate, population and land-use?     • What are the process mechanisms underlying these water and energy limitations  that lead to plant stress responses and regional vulnerabilities?    o How does plant stress relate to the water, energy and carbon budgets of  plants and particularly crops?   o What are the physical connections between plant metabolism and  indicators of stress, such as solar-induced fluorescence (SIF),  Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Evaporative Stress Index (ESI),  and soil moisture?   • How can we quantify the soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T)  components of evapotranspiration (ET), to better assess beneficial and non- beneficial water use in agricultural systems?    2 Space-based observations    2.1 Fluorescence and Narrowband Reflectance Indices  An ESA Earth Explorer 8 mission concept, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX), recently  received a unanimous recommendation (10/2015), to go forward to Phase A. FLEX will  fly in tandem with Sentinel-3 and provide global land observations for the full  chlorophyll emission spectrum (650-800 nm) including the red and far-red peaks, along  with visible through NIR hyperspectral (plus SWIR) radiances at ~300 m spatial scale.   ESA has also sponsored the FLEX’s airborne prototype instrument package, HyPlant,  which has provided high-resolution data in Europe and in the USA (during FLEX-US).   Satellite data for far-red solar induced fluorescence (SIF) have been obtained by two  European instruments (SCIAMACHY and GOME-2) and Japan’s GOSAT satellite at a  coarse global spatial scale (~0.5o). All of these satellite missions are in sun-synchronous  Low Earth Orbits (LEO) that offer near global coverage during the local mornings, which  may not be optimal for stress detection, and early afternoons. Geostationary (GEO) orbits  offer complementary information at a particular location by providing measurements at     3   several times throughout the day. There are currently no planned fluorescence  measurements from GEO instruments. However, coarse scale far-red fluorescence  measurements may be possible from planned atmospheric missions such as the NASA  EV-I 1 Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and the ESA Sentinel  4 will have some capabilities to measure fluorescence. These missions target areas of  North America and Europe only.   2.2 Thermal Infrared Radiometers  Thermal Infrared Radiometers (TIR) measure the composite radiative temperature (T) of  the soil surface and plant canopy. Methods to use spatial or temporal changes in T to  retrieve the total ET flux based on energy balance considerations are well developed  based on the current stock of geostationary (e.g. GOES or MSG SEVIRI: 3-5 km, 15  minute) and polar orbiting (PO) systems (e.g. MODIS: 1000 meter/daily, VIIRS:  375- 750m/daily, or Landsat: 100 m/biweekly).  However, the temporal support for TIR  imaging at typical field scales (100 m) is inadequate for most operational applications of  ET time series for water management.  Additional sensors at Landsat scale are required,  exploiting new, less-expensive TIR detector technologies (e.g., ECOSTRESS).    Furthermore, TIR-based retrievals of land-surface temperature are limited to clear-sky  conditions, severely limiting ET retrieval frequency in global regions with persistent  cloud cover.  Complementary all-sky T observations from microwave Ka band, although  at coarser spatial resolution (15km), can provide information to fill gaps in ET retrievals  during cloudy intervals.   2.3 Passive Microwave Radiometers  Passive microwave radiometers can provide important constraints to the characterization  of water stress through the measurement of soil moisture (SM).  NASA’s SMAP and  ESA’s SMOS missions are currently using L-band microwave technology for accurate  SM determination in all-weather conditions.  Multichannel radiometers (without L-band)  are part of four existing satellite programs: GCOM-W (JAXA), DMSP (DoD), GPM  (NASA), and FengYun (China).  These sensors complement TIR observations by  enabling estimation of land surface temperature (from Ka-band) under clear and cloudy  conditions.  The primary limitation to current passive microwave technology is spatial  resolution (~15 km for Ka-band, ~40 km for L-band).  There are no known commitments  from any space agency to continue passive microwave imaging capability through the  timeframe covered by the upcoming Decadal Survey.     2.4 Observational synergies  To fully address the characterization of water use, a complete measurement suite   (fluorescence, hyperspectral VIS/NIR, TIR, and passive microwave) is needed.   Transpiration estimates from fluorescence and hyperspectral indices (e.g., the  Photochemical Reflectance Index, PRI) collocated and coinciding with ET estimates  from a thermal-based energy balance approach would allow for E/T separation and  calculation of crop water productivity (‘crop-per-drop’).  Thermal infrared further bridges  the spatial scales of interest to agriculture (food and water security) and global climate  and weather models (climate impacts, ecosystem productivity).  For the latter, more  continuous sampling in clear and cloudy skies (provided by coincident passive     4   microwave observations) is needed to close the water balance over larger domains and  integrate over the growing season.   3 Linking space-based observations with other data   3.1 Calibration/Validation  All of these measurement types, but especially the fluorescence, will require calibration  and validation activities.  GSFC has helped support a first generation prototype field  spectrometer system, called FUSION, which currently has four high spectral resolution  spectrometers for fluorescence and narrow-band reflectance index measurements (e.g.,  PRI, EVI), and which makes unattended directional measurements throughout the day.   This system could be enhanced and combined with existing field systems designed for  energy and water balance measurements to provide a comprehensive and portable cal/val  platform for deployment at flux towers and other key sites.     3.2 Synthesis with other platforms  The characterization of ET via plant water use and stress also facilitates the diagnosis and  closure of the surface energy, water, and carbon balances from space. In terms of energy,  latent heat must be balanced with the residual of net radiation (CERES, Geostationary),  and sensible and ground heat flux (thermal instruments; Section 2.2). ET represents a  major component of the water balance, which can be constrained by synergistic  measurements of precipitation (GPM), change in water storage (SMAP, SMOS,  GRACE), and catchment scale runoff (SWOT). Finally, water use and stress within  plants is closely related to photosynthesis and can therefore be used in combination with  vegetation type/condition (VIIRS, Sentinel-2/3) and structure (GEDI, NiSAR,  BIOMASS) information to improve our knowledge of vegetation carbon uptake and  vegetation vulnerability to drought (in combination with CO2 flux estimates from OCO- 2).   3.3 Synthesis with Models  While land surface parameterizations used in Earth System models generally include  representations of photosynthesis and its relationship to water availability, these crude  representations would benefit from process understanding gleaned from analyses of the  proposed measurements.  Furthermore, by providing timely information on when  vegetation begins undergoing water stress, the measurements can provide information on  water content in the root zone, an otherwise unmeasurable (from space) quantity of  critical importance to crop and weather forecast models. Recently the capability to  simulate SIF within global models has been accomplished, for example in the NASA  Global Modeling and Assimilation Office’s Catchment-CN model. This provides a  powerful tool for evaluating model performance and offers potential new capabilities for  parameter estimation or data assimilation. However, higher resolution data and a better  suite of time of day measurements would enhance simulation results.     5   4 Anticipated scientific and societal benefits   To meet the food supply needs of the world’s growing population, global food production  will need to roughly double by 2050.   This increased production must be accomplished  within the constraints of a non-uniform distribution of freshwater resources, an  amplifying climate cycle, and concern for the environmental impacts of agriculture.  To  make significant strides in improving the production capacity and resiliency of global  agricultural systems, we must first better understand the regional distribution of factors  currently limiting production and water availability.   The ability to accurately quantify  beneficial (T) and non-beneficial (E) components of consumptive water use (ET) is  essential to improving water use efficiency in global agricultural production systems.     Robust early warning indicators highlighting regions with developing crop stress and  degrading canopy conditions due to drought or other stressors are needed to improve  within-season yield forecasts and to more effectively mobilize humanitarian response to  regional crop failures.   5  Key science communities that would be involved  Observing water stress as a key linkage between global carbon and water cycles requires  experts from multiple disciplines, including ecology, hydrology, agriculture, forestry,  weather and climate.  Synthesis of multiple observational technologies requires science  and engineering expertise in solar induced fluorescence, narrowband reflectance indices,  thermal infrared radiometry and passive microwave radiometry, combined with algorithm  development, and water and carbon cycle modeling and data assimilation.

Moist convection is a basic building block of the major storm systems of the planet, producing much of Earth’s precipitation, clouds, and extreme weather. Until recently, progress in representing moist convection in global numerical models has been elusive. But recent computational advances using limited-domain high-resolution “cloud-resolving” models have provided consistent options to represent convection in global models (de Rooy et al., 2013). The critical question is: which model options best represent reality for given environmental conditions? Answering this question is difficult because, despite the fundamental importance of deep convection, global model improvements are still mostly based on the use of other, higher resolution models. Existing observations of precipitation and cloud vertical structure, while useful as constraints, fail to discern the transport processes upon which convective closures are based. The moment is ripe for making new observations that will allow time-resolved monitoring of convective processes to improve their representation in numerical weather models – from the small-scale cloud-resolving models to the global scale climate prediction models. The vertical transport of mass and its impact on the interactions between tropical and extra-tropical circulations Deep tropical convection can be viewed as an entropy exchange process between the boundary layer and the tropical upper troposphere (TUT). The energy inserted into the TUT by tropical convection is in the form of increased mass associated with the updraft entropy of the convective plume, equivalent to an increase in potential energy at specific height levels, resulting from an increase in air density at that height. When compared to atmospheric layers at the same height in the extratropics, the air in the TUT is therefore of higher density, and so higher potential energy. Relative to the extratropical atmosphere, the excess tropical potential energy is “available” to be converted to kinetic energy (Lorenz, 1955). Given a permitted process, the energy conversion typically results in the formation of a subtropical jet structure (Krishnamurti, 1961). Because the upper troposphere is dynamically isolated from the surface-based frictional sources of angular momentum, air in this available potential energy (APE) “bubble” is essentially “trapped” by the inertial stability of Earth’s rotation. Deep tropical convection is therefore the vehicle that adds mass to the TUT, and only interaction with – or transport to – the extratropics can complete the energy cycle, which occurs in small-scale “surges” of the TUT into the extratropics (Mecikalski and Tripoli, 1998). It is still unclear what factors lead to the eruption of such tropical plumes from the tropical APE bubble.  Yet these surges transcend the diurnal cycle and so are most likely to spawn severe weather in the extratropics. Today’s models are still not able to accurately represent how the potential energy is built up by deep convection, or how it gets intermittently transferred from the TUT to the extratropical wave-train in localized bursts, influencing weather far downstream.  The vertical transport of moisture and its impact on climate and hydrological sensitivities Furthermore, convective transports influence the sensitivity of Earth’s climate system to forced change. Predicted increases in global mean surface temperature range between 2 and 4.6 K for a doubling of CO2 (Forster et al, 2013) and global precipitation increases of about 2–3% for each degree of warming. These are referred to as the climate and hydrological sensitivities, respectively, and the need to develop an understanding of the factors that determine them, and their regional consequences, underscores the grand science challenges posed by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP, Asrar et al, 2015). Inferences from observational records place the climate sensitivity near the lower end of the model range (Otto et al., 2013; Masters 2014; Lewis and Curry, 2015), and a hydrological sensitivity that is significantly larger than that predicted by state-of-the-art models (Zhang et al., 2007; Lambert et al., 2008; Durack et al., 2012). Reasons for these disparities based on unaccounted-for details of aerosol forcing have been proposed (Shindell, 2014), though missing negative feedbacks involving tropical high clouds produced by deep convection could also play a role (Mauritsen and Stevens, 2015).  One of the reasons climate is so sensitive to convective transport is because of its influence on water transports. Water in the atmosphere, both in vapor and condensed states, is such a strong absorber of infrared radiation, that the movement of water away from the warmer temperatures of the lower atmosphere to the colder temperatures of the upper troposphere dramatically enhances the Earth’s greenhouse effect. Global models of the Earth System have to make inadequately constrained assumptions about how much mass and water are deposited in the upper troposphere and then what fraction of this is spread out into high clouds through the process of detrainment. Climate and hydrological sensitivities are acutely sensitive to the assumptions relating to this pumping of water by deep convection. Improving the representation of the vertical structure of water in global climate models is absolutely critical if we are to accurately predict such climate and hydrological sensitivities.   Why is it the right time to observe the dynamics of convection Regarding moist convective processes, regional and global models that predict our weather and project how storms are likely to change with future warming are fast evolving. Climate model resolutions are changing from order 100km for climate models of the IPCC AR54 to 25km today. Weather forecast models are evolving even more rapidly. Global operational forecasts are now performed at or near 10km (IFS, GFS) and the resolutions of global forecast systems are expected to soon be on the order of 5km.  Because these models do not yet resolve the main convective transports directly, they have to resort to statistical approximations via a convective parameterization scheme. These schemes are guided mostly by cloud-resolving models. These models have emerged as important research tools in studying storms, and their outputs are now the basis for the statistical methods developed for coarser climate models. There has been a concerted effort over the recent years to produce global versions of these models in the form of slightly coarser “cloud resolving” models (CRMs) and today these latter models enable global simulations at resolutions of about 1-5km (e.g. NICAM). Yet these higher-resolution models still possess serious biases associated with the representation of convection and convective processes, including: · Transports of moisture, momentum, heat, trace gases and aerosols from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere that are too widespread and too weak (Lane and Moncrieff, 2010; van den Heever et al., 2011). · Precipitation that is typically far too frequent and too light in all models, with heavy precipitation far too infrequent (Chakraborty, 2010)  · Errors in the mean locations of convective precipitation are well documented, such as the persistence of an unrealistic double ITCZ. · Incorrect diurnal timing of the development, propagation and precipitation of severe convective storms leading to serious forecasting errors (Chakraborty, 2010; Mapes and Neale, 2011). · An overestimation of vertical updraft velocities in those numerical models that resolved vertical motion (Varble et al., 2014) In a nutshell, the numerical models are now ready for – and, indeed, need guidance from – systematic observations of the dynamics of convection.   Why are space observations critically needed The need to sample the dynamical properties of convection under the existing variety of environmental conditions of surface temperature, column specific humidity, lower-atmosphere moisture convergence and convective available potential energy requires a space-based observation strategy. Analyses of data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission have shown the extent to which the characteristics of convection vary around the globe and as a function of mesoscale systems (Houze et al, 2015). Indeed, the main water source necessary for deep convection is the low-level moisture convergence and the two main sinks of water are precipitation and the detrainment of air and condensate at the tops of tropical storms. Convective mass flux of air Qair is a measure of how much mass is lifted or sinks in convective plumes and is thus a principal diagnostic of the convective transport, a measure of convective strength and is the variable upon which convection parameterization closures are based (Yanai and Johnson, 1993). Despite its fundamental importance, no wide-scale information about Qair exists to guide parametrization development or to verify the credibility of predictions from finer-scale forecast systems. Nor indeed, are any global observations of the vertical motions through deep convective storms available.   Similarly, the vertical flux of condensed water Qcw is a measure of the moistening of the upper troposphere, and together with the rate of change (dCW/dt) of the condensed water mass CW, they quantify the efficiency with which TUT clouds are created (instead of CW precipitating out to the surface).  Neither Qair nor Qcw nor dCW/dt are currently observed systematically. Furthermore, observations of the vertical velocities within deep convective storms, a primary component of Qair and Qcw are not even routinely available. Not only are systematic observations necessary, they need to be sampled over the existing variety of environmental conditions (surface temperature, column specific humidity, lower-atmosphere moisture convergence, and convective available potential energy) within the wide range of deep convective storm types (from isolated convective towers through to the more dynamically organized mesoscale convective systems and hurricanes) in order to confirm (and quantify) the relations between convective development and the larger-scale conditions. Spatially or temporally limited observation strategies (such as fixed ground-based concepts or airborne campaigns) would fall far short of producing a sufficiently representative data set, both in terms of storm type and environmental conditions, to allow for robust inferences about existing parameterizations to be drawn, let alone for the development of more realistic parameterizations. However, from space, Qair, Qcw and dCW/dt can be observed given the emerging capability to build and formation-fly small satellites, to observe the temporal evolution as well as the spatial distribution of convective cores.   In summary, it is important and timely to start making systematic observations of the dynamics of tropical convection, including vertical air mass flux, flux of condensed water, updraft vertical velocities, and the time rate of change of condensed water mass, if we are to make significant strides forward in now-casting, sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting, data assimilation techniques, and to improve climate-scale modeling.

trace    gas    species,    good   agreement    between    instruments    is    found    and    the    atmospheric    mean    state   distributions    and    variability    can    be    considered    well-­‐known    (e.g.,    O3,    N2O,    CH4).   However,    for    other    species    that    are   measured    by    a    few    instruments    only    and    for   which    not    many    ground-­‐based    validation    measurements    are    available,    our   knowledge    is    still    limited    (e.g.,    CO,    and   many    short-­‐lived    species    such   as   HO2,   OH,   BrO,    ClO).    The    overall    recommendations    of    the    SPARC    Data    Initiative    highlight   species   or   regions   for   which   future   observations   are   most   needed:    • There    is    a    general   need    to    improve    trace   gas   observations    (especially   H2O)    in   the    tropical    and    extra-­‐tropical    UTLS.    Higher    spatial    and    temporal    resolution   measurements    that    also    penetrate    to    lower    altitudes    (well    into    the    upper   troposphere)   are   required   to   overcome   this   issue.       • Data   merging,   even   in   the   case   of   multiple   overlapping   instruments,   poses   a   key   challenge    and    impedes    our    understanding    of    long-­‐term    changes    of    the   stratosphere   in   a   changing   climate.   For   a   scenario   with   no   overlap   between   two   instruments,   the   possibility   to   derive   reliable   long-­‐term   changes   of   atmospheric   tracers   such   as   H2O   and   O3   would   be   eliminated.    • The   long-­‐term   monitoring   of   stratospheric   HCl   hinges   on   two   instruments   (ACE-­‐FTS    and    Aura-­‐MLS),    which    are    both    past    their    expected    lifetimes.    The   abundance    of    HCl    (scaled    to    yield    Cly)    in    the    stratosphere    is    an    important   measure   to   assess   the   effectiveness   of   the   Montreal   Protocol,   which   controls   the   use   of   chlorine-­‐containing   substances   that   lead   to   the   destruction   of   ozone.   New       HCl   measurements   are   needed   to   fulfill   the   obligations   to   the   Montreal   Protocol   in   the   future.    • At   present,   there   is   a   lack   of   measurements   that   provide   the   necessary   species   to    establish    budgets    of    chemical    families    such    as    Bry,    Cly    and    NOy.    Current   estimates   of   these   families   rely   heavily   on   the   use   of   chemical   box   models   and   hence   independent   validation   is   not   possible.   The    SPARC   Data    Initiative    evaluations    demonstrate    clearly    that    there    is    no    single   instrument   that   can   provide   measurements   of   the   full   suite   of   needed   atmospheric   trace    gas    species    with    high    vertical    and    horizontal    resolution,    high    accuracy    and   precision,    and    dense    data    coverage.    Only    a    comprehensive    set    of    high    quality   instruments    that    are    complementary    with    respect    to    data    coverage    and    target   species    allows    development    of    a    global    picture    of    stratospheric    composition.    In   order   to   monitor,   analyze   and   understand   atmospheric   composition,   transport   and   chemistry    in   the   future,   multiple    limb-­‐viewing    instruments   as   described   above   are   required.           Capabilities   of   existing   and   planned   U.S.   and   international   programs      It   has   to   be   expected   that   there   will   be   a   lack   of   adequate   limb   measurements   in   the   near    future.   This    looming   problem   is   due   to   an   ageing    fleet   of   currently   still    flying   limb    sounders    (Aura-­‐MLS,    ACE-­‐FTS,    OSIRIS    and    SMR)    along    with    the    lack    of    any   concrete   plans   to    launch   new   instruments   except    for   SAGE   III   on   the   International   Space    Station    (ISS)    (which    offers    only    limited    spatial    coverage)    and    the   OMPS-­‐LP   instruments    (which    have    only    limited    vertical    resolution,    especially    in    the    UTLS).   Also,    these    instruments    offer    observations    of    a    small    number    of    atmospheric   constituents   only   (both   measure   ozone   and   aerosol;   SAGE   III    in   addition   measures   H2O,   NO2,   and   NO3).   Thus,    there    is   an    impending   gap    in    the   global   observations   of   these   essential   climate   variables.      Given   the   future   key   challenges   in   the   field   of   atmospheric   chemistry   in   the   climate   system   and   the   impending   gap,   new   limb   satellite   missions   need   to   be   planned   and   executed    as    quickly    as    possible.        Key    for    the    future    planning    of    satellite    limb   sounders   is   to   design   measurement   systems   that   meet   specific   measurement   needs   in    terms    of    scientific    research    questions,    regions    of    interest,    resolution,    accuracy   and    precision.    Furthermore,    the    missions    need    to    offer    redundancy    between   measurements,   so   that   irregularities,   problems,   and   in   the   worst   case   failures   can   be   identified   early   and   investigated   adequately.       Anticipated   scientific   and   societal   benefits      Satellite    observations    of    stratospheric    composition    would    allow    for    the   investigation   of   outstanding   science   questions   relating   to   stratosphere-­‐troposphere   coupling,    future   climate,   and   air   pollution.   Air   quality    is   one   of    the   world’s   biggest   health   risks   according   to   the   WHO   with   annual   premature   death   rates   of   around   7   million   people   that   are   attributable   to   bad   air   quality.   The   stratosphere   has   recently   been    identified    to   play   an    important   role    in   determining   background   ozone    levels,   trends,   and    in   some   cases   even   extreme   pollution   events.   Future   air   quality   policy       regulations    from    national    governments    therefore    would    benefit    from    the   information   on   ‘natural’   contributions   to   air   pollution   from   the   stratosphere.       Involved   science   communities      The    importance    of

Strode (Universities Space Research Association), James S. Wang (Universities Space  Research Association)     Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG), influences the  atmosphere’s oxidizing capacity, and affects climate and air quality through its contribution to  tropospheric ozone formation.  Its 100-year and 20-year global warming potentials (GWP) are  28-32 times and 84-86 times, respectively, larger than those of CO2 (Myhre et al., 2013; Holmes  et al., 2013), making anthropogenic methane a critical target for mitigation (e.g., Kirschke et al.,  2013).  However, there are large uncertainties in methane’s anthropogenic sources (Ciais et al.,  2013) that must be reduced.  There are also large uncertainties associated with natural sources  and how they will respond to a warming climate.  These potentially substantial feedbacks would  accelerate climate change, including the possibility of the climate reaching a critical tipping  point.   The existing methane observing network has proven inadequate to 1) constrain global,  regional, and sectoral sources, and 2) explain observed trends and variations in atmospheric  methane over the last few decades.  These deficiencies limit confidence in modeling the future  evolution of methane.  Current surface measurement sites are mostly located far from methane’s  sources and continuity and/or expansion of the surface network alone would not be adequate to  constrain emissions given the spatial heterogeneity of the fluxes.  Existing large-footprint,  passive satellite observations are hampered by aerosol scattering and clouds, including over  tropical wetlands, and a lack of sunlight at higher latitudes, including the Arctic-Boreal Zone  (ABZ).   This is a critical time to establish a coordinated and comprehensive methane observing  network of passive and active instruments on both satellite and suborbital platforms for  constraining the strength and distribution of methane’s sources.  The network would allow for (a)  closure of the global methane budget, (b) better understanding of methane’s sources, including  regional and sectoral anthropogenic contributions, and (c) support new national and international  agreements to reduce GHGs.  Another critical part of this network is a suite of instruments to  observe the biogeochemical processes and feedbacks that control emissions from global wetlands  and permafrost thaw.  Timely deployment of such a network would allow for a crucial baseline  of current ABZ methane fluxes, against which to compare future releases.  Design of the  observing network would involve scientists from several communities, including atmosphere,  climate, radiation, biosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere.         2     What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?     A key challenge is constraining methane fluxes as there are a number of source types, some of   which have large discrepancies between bottom-up and top-down emission estimates (Ciais et  al., 2013; Kirschke et al., 2013).  Data from the existing observing network has not allowed for a  clear determination of the causes of methane’s observed trends and variations.  Surface  measurements from the Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (Dlugokencky et al., 2010) show  that the global methane growth rate began to level off in the 1990s, but there is only limited  understanding of the causes of the slowdown (e.g., Kirschke et al., 2013 and reference therein).   A decrease in fossil fuel, rice agriculture and livestock emissions (e.g., Kirschke et al., 2013) and  the trend toward more El Niño than La Niña events leading to lower wetland emissions (Hodson  et al., 2011) may have contributed.  Reaction with OH is the primary sink for methane, but  inferred trends in global OH are generally too small (e.g., Montzka et al., 2011) to explain the  slowdown.  After 2006, the methane growth rate began to increase and continues to do so, but  the causes are uncertain (e.g., Nisbet et al., 2014).   The processes that affect methane fluxes from wetlands and thawing permafrost are not well  understood, which has seriously limited our ability to project future emissions in a warmer and  wetter world.  The factors that affect microbial methane production are not well constrained  (e.g., Meng et al., 2012), and land cover, including wetlands, is not always well categorized (e.g.,  Frey and Smith, 2007).  The current methane growth rate may be associated with wetland  emissions (Dlugokencky et al., 2009; Bousquet et al., 2011) and many observed global  anomalies are thought to be associated with fluctuations in wetland emissions (e.g., Wang et al.,  2004; Kirschke et al., 2013).  Current process-based models predict a wide range of emission  estimates (e.g., ± 40% for annual global emissions) as shown in the recent Wetland and Wetland  CH4 Inter-comparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP; Melton et al., 2013) and confidence in  these emissions is low (Ciais et al, 2013).     Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?     Numerous Earth science datasets indicate that climate change is occurring rapidly (Walsh et   al., 2014).  As methanogenesis exhibits a strong temperature dependence (Yvon-Durocher et al.,  2014), the primary scientific question for methane is how climate change will affect wetlands,  permafrost and the stability of methane hydrates in a warmer, wetter world, including how  potential feedbacks could accelerate climate change.  There is a critical need for a baseline of  current fluxes against which to compare possible future releases and feedbacks (e.g., O’Connor  et al., 2010; Ciais et al., 2013).  Additionally, knowledge of methane along with CO2 is necessary  to close the carbon budget.  Effective national and international regulations to reduce GHGs  require sound scientific knowledge of both natural and anthropogenic methane sources, which  could be accomplished with data from a coordinated and comprehensive space-based observing  system.  Given the time required to design instruments and launch satellites, it is critical to begin  establishing this observing system.           3     Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?     The primary advantage of satellites is spatial coverage, including in areas that are difficult to  collect in situ data (NRC, 2003).  There is a critical need for long-term observations of methane  and the processes that affect it, which would be best met from a suite of satellite sensors in  combination with suborbital data, particularly in the ABZ.  Given the importance of constraining  methane fluxes for climate and the urgency of monitoring the potential climate feedbacks,  redundancy in the satellite observing network is critical.   Our ability to estimate emission fluxes with inverse modeling studies (e.g., Bergamaschi et al.,  2013) is limited because these estimates have depended on the sparse surface network of  methane observations.  Isotopic measurements provide information on methane’s sources,  however, routine observations are expensive and very limited (Dlugokencky et al., 2011).   Therefore, quantification of methane’s sources depends on high-resolution (in space and time)  global observations provided by space-borne missions, as well as, credible and similarly resolved  models of the processes that affect methane fluxes.   Satellite methane column data, which are retrieved from NIR/SWIR wavelengths, are used to  infer methane fluxes (e.g., Zhang et al., 2013).  The main products are 1) the now defunct  SCIAMACHY (2002 – 2012), which had detector degradation beginning in 2005 resulting in  lower quality data afterwards, and 2) the JAXA GOSAT (2009 – present), which has sparse  coverage, particularly over major source regions in the tropics and high latitudes.  ESA  TROPOMI is expected to launch in 2016 and will have similar capabilities as SCIAMACHY, a  7-year design life, and better spatial coverage than GOSAT.  TIR instruments, such as AIRS,  TES and IASI, lack sensitivity near the surface and, therefore, are not useful for inferring surface  fluxes though they may provide complementary information to column data.  Other methane  mission concepts are discussed in Moore et al. (2014).   Our ability to estimate fluxes from methane column data is limited by clouds and aerosol  scattering, which lead to data gaps.  However, satellite measurements of other quantities detect  variability in some of the factors known to control wetland fluxes and, thus, are useful for  quantifying the processes governing methane fluxes.  Microwave instruments provide inundation  depths and have the advantage of detecting through clouds.  Bloom et al. (2010) used GRACE  gravity anomalies as a proxy for water table depth.  Suborbital observations in data sparse  regions (tropics, high latitudes) could complement satellite data and improve understanding of  flux processes.   Inferring ABZ methane fluxes is particularly difficult for sensors relying on reflected sunlight  (e.g., GOSAT, TROPOMI) because of limited sun angles and atmospheric scatter.  Highly- elliptical orbits, such as the Molniya orbit, are proposed to increase integration time over the  ABZ (e.g., Nassar et al., 2014).  The active sensor, MERLIN (expected launch in 2019; Ehret et  al., 2010; Kiemle et al., 2014), will demonstrate the capability to constrain methane fluxes in  cloudy and/or low-light environments, but its 3-year design lifetime will not address the critical  need for long-term, continuous observations.   Summary:  A space-based, long-term and comprehensive observing network for methane is  necessary to close the budgets for atmospheric methane and carbon, which is essential for  developing effective strategies to reduce GHGs.  This network will aid process-based  understanding of emissions from wetlands, the largest single methane source and primary cause  of global interannual variations, and from permafrost thaw.  It is critical to begin establishing this  network as 1) the design and deployment of satellites takes time and 2) numerous datasets  confirm the onset of human-induced climate change.      4     References  Bergamaschi, P., et al.

Stiller, Bernd Funke and Manuel Lo´pez-Puertas  A key question in Earth system science is how climate change interacts with middle atmospheric circulation and composition. Another key issue is the monitoring of stratospheric ozone recovery and its feedback onto atmo- spheric processes. Limb emission measurements and limb measurement of scattered or attenuated sun- moon- or starlight provides vertically resolved information (profiles) with good global coverage of temperature and many atmospheric constituents over the altitude range of approximately 5–140 km, depending on instrument and species. A golden age of middle atmospheric observations has come to an end. ENVISAT and its instruments were lost in April 2012 and the remaining missions (Odin with OSIRIS and SMR, SCISAT-1 with ACE and MAESTRO, Aura with MLS and OMI, and TIMED with SABER) are beyond their expected lifetimes. The NASA OMPS and SAGE-III missions are short-duration missions, and provide information on a limited set of species. SAGE-III will be hosted by the ISS and thus will not cover the poles. Facing this limb gap, a limb mission with global cover- age, providing information about as many as relevant atmospheric species as possible is overdue to monitor and understand the middle and upper atmo- sphere’s interaction with climate change.  Evidence of changing stratospheric circulation has been found by analysis of altitude and latitude resolved trends of stratospheric SF6 (Stiller et al., 2012). The exact patterns of these changes are still not fully explained, and thus no reliable prediction of the circulation of the stratosphere is possible yet. Linked to these circulation issues is the exchange of upper atmospheric air with the stratosphere. Huge amounts of mesospheric and thermospheric air intrude into the polar winter stratosphere and interact with stratospheric chemistry. The intensity of such events is coupled with stratospheric cir- culation and thus with climate change. Monitoring of such events requires continuous global altitude-resolved measurements of involved chemical reac- tants and suitable tracers.  Due to its role as the primary greenhouse gas, the temporal evolution of water vapour in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is of par- ticular importance. The stratospheric water vapour budget is controlled by import from the troposphere, freeze-drying, dehydration, methane ox- idation and stratospheric circulation. To diagnose these processes, highly  1    altitude-resolved continuous measurements of H2O, CH4, temperature, and, if possible, also HDO are needed.  Another crucial stratospheric climate driver is aerosol. Volcanoes can both directly inject particle matter into the stratosphere or SO2, of which aerosols are a secondary product. To better understand this natural compo- nent of climate change requires a better understanding of the stratospheric sulphur cycle. Besides their primary relevance in the context of the Earth’s radiative budget, aerosols are important also as surfaces where heterogeneous reactions occur.  While some information on ozone will be available from OMPS and SAGE-III, no polar night measurements will be available. For the unam- biguous detection of the recovery of stratospheric ozone, continuous verti- cally resolved long-term global data records, covering the whole globe and particularly polar winter in both hemispheres are needed. Dense spatial and temporal sampling is required to distinguish chemical from dynamical effects and to avoid sampling artefacts.  Attribution of ozone changes to its causes requires knowledge of dynami- cal tracers. Measurement of species like CFCs, N2O, CH4, CFCs, CO SF6 or NOy allows analysis of vertical and horizontal transport and mixing processes (Glatthor et al., 2005; Funke et al., 2009; Stiller et al., 2012). Measurement of reactive species (ClOx, NOx and HOx) along with their reservoirs (HNO3, ClONO2 and N2O5) is essential for the understanding of ozone chemistry in a changing climate.  Solar atmospheric interactions are particularly important for ozone chem- istry (Lo´pez-Puertas et al., 2005), and also for the atmospheric water vapour budget (Schieferdecker et al., 2015). Evidence of atmospheric perturbations due to precipitating solar protons, energetic electrons, and radiative effects, both locally in the stratosphere or via subsidence of processed air from the mesosphere and thermosphere has been found (e.g. Funke et al., 2011, 2014). Since the Golden Age of Earth Observation lasted only for about one solar cycle, a large part of our knowledge on solar-terrestrial interaction is still un- certain. Particularly the knowledge on processes related to the 11-year solar cycle is of poor statistical significance. Extension of altitudinally and latitudi- nally resolved time series of involved species is badly needed. To understand the effect of increasing tropospheric CO2 onto the stratosphere, monitoring of upper atmospheric CO2 and temperature are crucial. Two recent studies have shown that the increase rate of CO2 in the middle/upper atmosphere is larger than in the troposphere (Emmert et al., 2012; Yue et al., 2015) and then might affect the upper atmosphere density and planning spacecraft  2    flight paths (Emmert et al., 2010). Similarly, to meaure the NO cooling of the thermosphere is fundamental for understanding the evolution of the upper atmosphere density (Mlynczak et al., 2010).  The interaction of the key processes described above require a holistic research approach which involves measurement of multiple species. The ideal instrument measures ozone, water vapour and its isotopes, the reactants NOx, ClOx, and HOx, their reservoirs, dynamical tracers (CH2, N2O, CFCs, CO, SF6), sulphur compounds, and organic species which help to better quantify the import of tropospheric air into the stratosphere. Continuous global measurements are needed, which cover the upper troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the thermosphere. These requirements are best fulfilled by a limb emission sounder or limb imager on a polar orbit. Since the required gases have bands in the mid infrared but can be detected only at sufficiently high spectral resolution, a Fourier transform spectrometer is the instrument of choice. Optimally, it would be complemented by a microwave limb spectrometer. Past space missions have demonstrated the adequacy of suggested techniques, technological readines (MIPAS, MLS etc), and the technical readiness of improved methods (e.g. limb imaging instead of limb scanning) has been highlighted by airborne demonstrator missions (GLORIA (Friedl-Vallon et al., 2014)).  The research communities involved cover the scientists investigating cli- mate change, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, stratospheric ozone, mon- itoring of trace gases, solar terrestrial connection, aerosol, radiative bud- get, stratospheric radiative transfer, data assimilation, inverse modelling, retrieval, interferometry, spectroscopy, and many more. Both experimental (AGAGE, NDACC etc) and theoretical (modelling) communities would be involved.  The societal benefits are those of climate research in general and thus do not need any additional discussion.  References  Emmert, J. T., Lean, J. L., and Picone, J. M. (2010).

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   Creating a comprehensive integrated observing system in an environment of stagnant budgets is a key  challenge for Earth System Science operations.  An integrated observing system would complement existing  space-based assets by providing airborne and ground measurements to advance NASA's and the broader  Earth Science research community's science goals.  Specifically, coordinated, cross-Agency investments in  an integrated observing strategy could enable more rapid progress toward answering a broad array of key  science needs such as gaining a better understanding of and improving predictive capability for changes in  climate forcing and air quality associated with changes in atmospheric composition.    For example, understanding of how the sources of methane are changing over time requires a coordinated  approach.  Satellite observations provide important data locations of persistent atmospheric “hot” spots of  high methane concentrations (like the U.S. 'Four Corners' region).  But, the relative infrequency and  inadequate spatital/vertical detail of satellite observations does not enable the community to understand why  these hot spots exist.  Airborne measurements can provide the finer resolution that are required to identify  sources (e.g., coal bed methane extraction, active coal mines, natural gas seeps, thawing permafrost) and  processes that lead to enhanced methane emission for state/local decision makers.  Airborne and ground  measurements can also provide important data for validating and constraining top-down emission estimates  from the satellite data.    The need for synergistic measurements (with higher spatial and temporal resolution) involving multiple  instruments (e.g., radar, radiometer, and lidar observations), and different platforms (e.g., geosynchronous,  low-Earth orbit, and airborne) is well-recognized throughout the community but the available budgetary  resources are limited.  In order to close this gap and answer the key science questions, new types of  platforms (e.g., small satellites, cube sats, and long-endurance (LE) uncrewed aerial vehicles) are needed.   This NOI describes how one of these alternative platforms, LE UAVs, can fulfill an important part of the  observing system and complement space-based measurements.    2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?     Space-based instruments have provided critical observations of the Earth's atmosphere and surface over  the last 50+ years. These observations have enabled the Earth Science community to gain an almost infinite  improvement in their understanding of the weather and climate system. It is clear that a space-based Earth  observing system will continue to be critical over the coming decades to monitor weather and climate  change.  Despite the vast array of benefits provided by space-based platforms, it has also become clear to  the community that space-based platforms have key limitations that inhibit our understanding of processes  that occur at fine temporal and spatial scales.  In addition, development of new satellite programs requires a  significant financial commitment over a number of years, a hurdle that can inhibit innovation and limit  progress toward addressing critical science questions.       It is imperative that the community continues to develop alternative Earth observation instruments and  platforms that can fill gaps in our existing observational network and knowledge at an affordable cost.   Airborne field campaigns have been conducted in recent years to study a variety of processes and  phenomena at fine detail, validate satellite-based observations and derived products, and demonstrate new  instrument technology that could later be flown in space.  These campaigns are invaluable to the Earth  Science community and can be conducted a relatively low cost (10s of millions vs. 100s-1000s of millions for  a satellite program).  But these campaigns are typically focused over limited geographic domains and cannot  be sustained for long time periods (i.e. continuous flight for one-week) due to the limited endurance of  `traditional` crewed aircraft (see Figure 1) and strain on aircraft crew and campaign science teams.         Airborne assets such as LE UAVs could fly autonomously and continuously for multi-day time periods, offer  unique capabilities that cannot be provided by other observing platforms.  LE UAVs could collect detailed  observations at fine spatial and temporal scales over broad geographic regions, representing a bridge  between previous short-term and geographically limited crewed aircraft campaigns and long-term but coarse  space-based observations. Recently, NASA and NOAA have begun to demonstrate the value of LE UAV  observations to the Earth System Science community with the NASA Global Hawk. The Global Hawk  provides up to 30 hours endurance, can fly at a 65,000 foot altitude, and can be outfitted with a variety  sensors that weigh up to ~2000 lbs.  The Global Hawk was able to fly above and around the tropical  cyclones and hazardous thunderstorms within the NASA Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) and  the NOAA Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology (SHOUT) programs, collecting  innovative and sustained observations of storm internal structure and the surrounding environment. These  observations have helped scientists to better understand dynamical processes occurring within storms and  the wind flow that dictates their path. Cyclone intensity and track predictions improve when these  observations, in concert with satellite-based and other conventional datasets, are assimilated into numerical  weather prediction models.  The Global Hawk has also been used to provide a comprehensive set of water  vapor, cloud, and air chemistry observations within the tropical tropopause and lower stratosphere through  the NASA Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX).  The Global Hawk was used to profile the  atmosphere at high altitudes over remote oceanic regions that would otherwise be inaccessible to existing  crewed research aircraft.    Over the coming decade, a new set of LE UAVs will be emerging with support primarily from the defense  and information technology industries (Google, Facebook, and many others).  LE UAVs currently being  tested and/or developed will offer 5-7 day endurance or greater with maximum altitudes above of 60,000  feet, capabilities that far exceed those of the Global Hawk and other crewed aircraft (see Figure 1).  These  vehicles would be outfitted with state of the art autonomy and sense and avoid technologies that will enable  flight above populated regions, assuming the continued development of Federal Aviation Administration  regulations governing safe operation of UAVs in the National Airspace System. Most significantly, these  vehicles are being designed to overcome the key challenges faced by today’s UAV platforms, namely  operational cost and large logistical ground footprints, proprietary systems and interfaces that limit payload  modularity and flexibility, and extensive and time consuming mission planning requirements. The net result  is a potential `satellite-like` atmospheric monitoring capability at greatly reduced cost.        Figure 1: The relationship between endurance and maximum cruise altitude of `traditional` crewed NASA  research aircraft (e.g. ER-2, WB-57, DC-8, and King Air) relative to current and proposed next-generation  LE UAVs.               3. Why are observations from alternative observational platforms fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     The capabilities of LE UAVs enable a wealth of new science that can greatly complement and enhance the  space-based observing system over the coming decades.  A constellation of LE UAVs could be operated  continuously over land and ocean, downlinking data to the ground for immediate visualization by forecasters  or assimilation into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.  A LE UAV could perform targeted  observations in regions where there is the most uncertainty in the NWP model analysis, thereby improving  forecasts of high impact weather events. LE UAVs could loiter over a given region for long time periods,  providing valuable insight into the evolution of processes such as transport and diurnal variability of pollution  from urban areas.  LE UAVs can also follow features such as smoke, volcanic ash, or pollution plumes with  time to study their characteristics and evolution throughout their lifetime, in addition to identifying potential  hazards for commercial aviation flying 20,000+ feet below. The endurance of LE UAVs enables them to  reach regions typically inaccessible to crewed research aircraft such as the Southern Pacific Ocean or the  Poles.  Long range also enables collection of a comprehensive database of cloud, chemistry, and aerosol  properties over broad geographic regions, a process that would be very costly or, in some cases, impossible  to do.  LE UAVs can also help to perform rigorous validation of satellite-derived products and collect  necessary training datasets to enable development of more accurate products.  The much lower altitude of  the UAV relative to a satellite permits detailed vertical profiling of the planetary boundary layer, a capability  not provided by most satellite-based instruments.  Another valuable aspect of a UAV is that, if an instrument  were to fail in some way, the UAV can land and the instrument could potentially be replaced or repaired in a  short period of time which would not currently be possible with a satellite.  The capabilities of next-generation LE UAVs will cause a paradigm shift in how the community collects Earth  Science observations. Instead of operating UAVs like aircraft which require a large support team on the  ground, a satellite-like operational concept can be applied where a fleet manager oversees the autonomous  operation of multiple airborne assets with very little required hands-on interaction. This new paradigm will  enable a “satellite-like” monitoring capability at a fraction of the cost of a large satellite mission with the  inherent flexibility of aircraft-based operations.  LE UAVs represent an emerging Earth Science and  Applications support capability, offering opportunities to leverage existing interagency activities to augment  space-based Earth observations and improve overall resiliency.   An upcoming Decadal Survey White Paper  will provide greater detail on our vision of how LE UAVs will complement space-based observations and  serve as a critical component within an integrated Earth observing system.

Anderson and Steven C. Wofsy  I. Key Challenges for Earth System Science  Summary of the Problem:  We now know, through the union of high altitude in situ aircraft, satellite and NEXRAD weather radar  observations, that the stratosphere over the US in summer  is vulnerable to ozone loss as a result of a series of factors  unique, worldwide, to the central US in summer. The key  elements that couple climate forcing to ozone loss in the  lower stratosphere over the US in summer are  summarized in Figure 1 and reviewed here:  1. Convection, as a result of severe storms over the   Great Plains, delivers both markedly enhanced water  vapor, as well as catalytic radical precursors from the  lower troposphere, deep into the stratosphere over the  US in summer.   2. The depth of convective injection is sufficient to  reach altitudes of rapidly increasing available  inorganic chlorine that is then catalytically converted  on simple, ubiquitous, binary water-sulfate aerosols,  to free radical form, ClO.   3. It is the chlorine radical, ClO, that couples to the  available BrO radical to form a catalytic cycle rate  limited by ClO + BrO → Cl + Br + O2 in  combination with ClO + ClO ! ClOOCl that  constitutes the catalytic mechanisms capable of  removing ozone; and it is the same mechanism that  contributes to very large ozone loss over the polar  regions in winter.   4. Anti-cyclonic flow in the lower stratosphere over the  US in summer, as a result of the North American  monsoon, contains that convective injection in a gyre  that provides time (days to weeks), for  photochemistry to catalytically remove ozone.   5. The remarkable sensitivity of increases in the skin  cancer incidence in the US to fractional decreases in  ozone column concentration places strict demands on  the quantitative understanding required to accurately forecast ozone losses and the requisite increase  in skin cancer incidence in the US in a changing climate.   6. The frequency and intensity of severe storms over the Great Plains of the US is increasingly tied to  increased forcing of the climate by increasing levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the Earth’s atmosphere.  As a result, climate forcing is mechanistically linked to forecasts of ozone reduction in the  stratosphere over the US in summer.   7. These issues of the close coupling between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic ozone loss with  the associated aerosols in the lower stratosphere must be linked to emerging strategic plans for  climate engineering via solar radiation management (SRM) that proposes the addition of aerosols to  the lower stratosphere to reflect solar radiation, thereby reducing shortwave forcing of the climate.   Figure 1. Graphical representation of the link  between climate forcing by increased CO2 and CH4  release, convective injection of water deep into the  summer stratosphere over the US, entrapment by  the anticyclonic North American monsoon flow and  the catalytic chemistry linking halogen radicals to  ozone loss in the lower stratosphere.     These developments engage the advancing union of observational techniques, the human health  implications of ozone loss, the issue of proposed climate engineering via SRM, and key evidence of the  climate structure from the paleorecord.     II. Key Unanswered Scientific Questions in the Coupling of Climate Forcing with Ozone Loss  in the Stratosphere Over the US in Summer  We can summarize the factors that have emerged regarding (a) the dynamical structure of the stratosphere  over the US in summer and (b) the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic chemistry of the lower  stratosphere that, taken together, converge to imply that the column concentration of ozone in July and  August is vulnerable to reductions involving the same reactions responsible for ozone loss over the Arctic  in winter. The mechanisms that link climate change with ozone loss in the stratosphere are summarized in  Figure 2.         The recognition of the unique attributes of the dynamics and catalytic chemistry of the lower stratosphere  over the US in summer creates the imperative to answer the following questions.   1. What combination of physical mechanisms is responsible for the observed deep stratospheric  convective injection of water vapor into the stratosphere over the US in summer?   2. How will the processes that compel that deep stratospheric injection respond to increased forcing  of the climate by the addition of increasing amounts of CO2, CH4, N2O, etc. to the atmosphere?   3. What is the structure of the 3D velocity fields within the storm structure in the stratosphere? What  factors control the degree of irreversible injection of water and radical precursors into the  stratosphere?   4. What is the structure of the wave breaking events associated with the convective intrusion? How  do these wave breaking events affect the vertical kinetic energy of the deep convective events?   Figure 2. There are unique aspects of the stratosphere over the US in summer that  conspire to produce the situation wherein the ozone column is vulnerable to reduction  resulting from the combination of convective injection, containment by the anti-cyclonic  flow in the lower stratosphere and catalytic photochemistry resulting from the conversion  of inorganic chlorine to free radical form in simple binary sulfate-water aerosols.     5. What are the concentrations of species co-injected with water by the convective event?  6. What are the concentrations of (a) the reactive chemical precursors that are normally removed by   photolysis or oxidation in the troposphere and (b) the chemical tracers brought in by the  convective storm or drawn in by the perturbation associated with the convection?   7. How does the structure of the convective injection alter the potential temperature surfaces in the  vicinity of the injection?   8. What is the subsequent fate of the chemical cocktail convectively injected into the stratosphere in  the hours and days following the convective injection?   9. Does the catalytic photochemistry linking sulfate aerosols and water vapor to the conversion of  inorganic chlorine to free radical form mirror the same chemistry as a function of temperature and  water vapor that was verified in the stratosphere over the Arctic?   10. Does the region of convective injection into the lower stratosphere decrease in temperature as a  function of time due to enhanced radiative cooling in agreement with calculated cooling rates?   11. What is the observed covariance of the local ozone concentration with the rate limiting free  radicals ClO and BrO as a function of time following convective injection?   12. What combination of observables are best suited for testing the response of stratospheric ozone to  increasing convection into the stratosphere? What is required to develop a trusted forecast of  ozone column concentrations over the US in summer in the face of increased climate forcing by  CO2 and CH4.   III. Why is This Issue Timely:      • The ozone shield is arguably the most delicate aspect of habitability on the planet’s surface. If the  entire stratospheric ozone column were brought to standard temperature and pressure, that ozone  column would be ~ 0.5 cm in depth.

Anderson and Steven C. Wofsy  I. Key Challenges for Earth System Science  Summary of the Problem:  We now know, through the union of high altitude in situ aircraft, satellite and NEXRAD weather radar  observations, that the stratosphere over the US in summer  is vulnerable to ozone loss as a result of a series of factors  unique, worldwide, to the central US in summer. The key  elements that couple climate forcing to ozone loss in the  lower stratosphere over the US in summer are  summarized in Figure 1 and reviewed here:  1. Convection, as a result of severe storms over the   Great Plains, delivers both markedly enhanced water  vapor, as well as catalytic radical precursors from the  lower troposphere, deep into the stratosphere over the  US in summer.   2. The depth of convective injection is sufficient to  reach altitudes of rapidly increasing available  inorganic chlorine that is then catalytically converted  on simple, ubiquitous, binary water-sulfate aerosols,  to free radical form, ClO.   3. It is the chlorine radical, ClO, that couples to the  available BrO radical to form a catalytic cycle rate  limited by ClO + BrO → Cl + Br + O2 in  combination with ClO + ClO ! ClOOCl that  constitutes the catalytic mechanisms capable of  removing ozone; and it is the same mechanism that  contributes to very large ozone loss over the polar  regions in winter.   4. Anti-cyclonic flow in the lower stratosphere over the  US in summer, as a result of the North American  monsoon, contains that convective injection in a gyre  that provides time (days to weeks), for  photochemistry to catalytically remove ozone.   5. The remarkable sensitivity of increases in the skin  cancer incidence in the US to fractional decreases in  ozone column concentration places strict demands on  the quantitative understanding required to accurately forecast ozone losses and the requisite increase  in skin cancer incidence in the US in a changing climate.   6. The frequency and intensity of severe storms over the Great Plains of the US is increasingly tied to  increased forcing of the climate by increasing levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the Earth’s atmosphere.  As a result, climate forcing is mechanistically linked to forecasts of ozone reduction in the  stratosphere over the US in summer.   7. These issues of the close coupling between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic ozone loss with  the associated aerosols in the lower stratosphere must be linked to emerging strategic plans for  climate engineering via solar radiation management (SRM) that proposes the addition of aerosols to  the lower stratosphere to reflect solar radiation, thereby reducing shortwave forcing of the climate.   Figure 1. Graphical representation of the link  between climate forcing by increased CO2 and CH4  release, convective injection of water deep into the  summer stratosphere over the US, entrapment by  the anticyclonic North American monsoon flow and  the catalytic chemistry linking halogen radicals to  ozone loss in the lower stratosphere.     These developments engage the advancing union of observational techniques, the human health  implications of ozone loss, the issue of proposed climate engineering via SRM, and key evidence of the  climate structure from the paleorecord.     II. Key Unanswered Scientific Questions in the Coupling of Climate Forcing with Ozone Loss  in the Stratosphere Over the US in Summer  We can summarize the factors that have emerged regarding (a) the dynamical structure of the stratosphere  over the US in summer and (b) the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic chemistry of the lower  stratosphere that, taken together, converge to imply that the column concentration of ozone in July and  August is vulnerable to reductions involving the same reactions responsible for ozone loss over the Arctic  in winter. The mechanisms that link climate change with ozone loss in the stratosphere are summarized in  Figure 2.         The recognition of the unique attributes of the dynamics and catalytic chemistry of the lower stratosphere  over the US in summer creates the imperative to answer the following questions.   1. What combination of physical mechanisms is responsible for the observed deep stratospheric  convective injection of water vapor into the stratosphere over the US in summer?   2. How will the processes that compel that deep stratospheric injection respond to increased forcing  of the climate by the addition of increasing amounts of CO2, CH4, N2O, etc. to the atmosphere?   3. What is the structure of the 3D velocity fields within the storm structure in the stratosphere? What  factors control the degree of irreversible injection of water and radical precursors into the  stratosphere?   4. What is the structure of the wave breaking events associated with the convective intrusion? How  do these wave breaking events affect the vertical kinetic energy of the deep convective events?   Figure 2. There are unique aspects of the stratosphere over the US in summer that  conspire to produce the situation wherein the ozone column is vulnerable to reduction  resulting from the combination of convective injection, containment by the anti-cyclonic  flow in the lower stratosphere and catalytic photochemistry resulting from the conversion  of inorganic chlorine to free radical form in simple binary sulfate-water aerosols.     5. What are the concentrations of species co-injected with water by the convective event?  6. What are the concentrations of (a) the reactive chemical precursors that are normally removed by   photolysis or oxidation in the troposphere and (b) the chemical tracers brought in by the  convective storm or drawn in by the perturbation associated with the convection?   7. How does the structure of the convective injection alter the potential temperature surfaces in the  vicinity of the injection?   8. What is the subsequent fate of the chemical cocktail convectively injected into the stratosphere in  the hours and days following the convective injection?   9. Does the catalytic photochemistry linking sulfate aerosols and water vapor to the conversion of  inorganic chlorine to free radical form mirror the same chemistry as a function of temperature and  water vapor that was verified in the stratosphere over the Arctic?   10. Does the region of convective injection into the lower stratosphere decrease in temperature as a  function of time due to enhanced radiative cooling in agreement with calculated cooling rates?   11. What is the observed covariance of the local ozone concentration with the rate limiting free  radicals ClO and BrO as a function of time following convective injection?   12. What combination of observables are best suited for testing the response of stratospheric ozone to  increasing convection into the stratosphere? What is required to develop a trusted forecast of  ozone column concentrations over the US in summer in the face of increased climate forcing by  CO2 and CH4.   III. Why is This Issue Timely:      • The ozone shield is arguably the most delicate aspect of habitability on the planet’s surface. If the  entire stratospheric ozone column were brought to standard temperature and pressure, that ozone  column would be ~ 0.5 cm in depth. A 5% reduction in column ozone concentration over the US  translates to a 15% increase in new skin cancer cases each year — i. e. slightly exceeding 500,000  additional skin cancer cases per annum in the US alone. This defines the accuracy to which the  forecast of ozone column concentration changes must be quantitatively trusted in response to  increased forcing of the climate by CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.   • We have experience with, and have witnessed directly, the dramatic loss of ozone within the  polar vortices in both hemispheres in late winter and early spring each year.

With the combination of in  situ aircraft, satellite and NEXRAD observations, we now know that the conditions required for  catalytic removal of ozone can be met over the US in summer as a result of deep stratospheric  convective injection of water vapor and radical precursors in combination with extended  containment of that injection by the anticyclonic flow in the lower stratosphere over the  continental US resulting from the North American monsoon in July and August.   • The dependence of the frequency and intensity of severe storms over the US is increasingly tied  in the scientific literature to the increased forcing of the climate by the release of greenhouse  gases from fossil fuel combustion.

Mlynczak1, and Xianglei Huang4  1 NASA Langley Research Center 2 University of Colorado, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics 3 Science System & Applications Inc. 4 University of Michigan at Ann Arber  1. Introduction Atmospheric temperature, specific humidity, and cloud properties are expected to change due to radiative perturbations caused by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide. Understanding how clouds and atmospheric properties change with time under radiative forcing is necessary to understand feedback (e.g. Knutti and Hegerl 2008). Because changes are small compared to natural variability of these properties (i.e. Wielicki et al. 2013), detecting changes is extremely challenging. Even though these properties are currently retrieved globally from satellite-based instruments, the uncertainty in the calibration of instruments usually makes it difficult to detect such changes within the lifetime of the instruments or even the duration of the missions. In this document, therefore, we briefly discuss needs for an alternative approach suitable for climate change signal detection but complementary to approaches currently used in retrieving temperature, humidity, and cloud properties. Generally, global cloud and atmospheric properties are retrieved from satellite-based instruments using their instantaneous observations. Subsequently, retrieved values from an instrument’s field-of-view are averaged and the time rate of change of cloud or atmospheric properties can be inferred from averaged properties (retrieve-then-average approach). This is simple in concept but identifying artifacts of the retrieval is difficult in practice. Even if the same algorithm is used for the retrieval throughout the period, instrument calibration shifts and changes in inputs used for the retrieval (e.g. source of temperature or water vapor profiles), cause artifacts. In addition, the complexity of retrieval algorithms makes tracing error propagations and the error estimate in retrieved properties difficult, especially if the error is time-dependent. An alternative way to derive a trend of cloud and atmospheric properties is to tie their property change directly to the observed radiance change. This average-then-retrieve approach carries observed radiances as far as possible and retrieved values are directly tied to instrument stability (i.e. repeatability and reproducibility, Taylor and Kuyatt 1994). However, it requires separating cloud and atmospheric property changes contributing to the highly spatial- and temporally-averaged observed radiance change. In addition, the average-then-retrieve approach can retrieve anomalies or changes in cloud and atmospheric properties occurring over a region and a time period directly. Although mean values are not derived, there is an advantage in deriving anomalies directly. If the error is time-dependent (e.g. aliasing seasonal temperature or water vapor variability), the error in mean values affecting anomalies is difficult to eliminate. Because anomalies are much smaller than means, a small time-dependent error affects anomalies significantly. In addition, although unknown bias errors in the calibration affect both approaches, once observed radiances are averaged, both instrument noise and natural variability are reduced, with the larger the time and space averaging, the larger the reduction.   Some basic studies had been performed to investigate the possibility of the average-then-retrieve approach for climate applications. Earlier results are summarized in the next section. However, more work is required for the average-to-retrieve approach to be actually used in the future. Some of key challenges in developing the average-then-retrieve approach are also summarized in the next section.   2. Average-then-retrieve approach The average-then-retrieve approach uses highly spatial- and temporally averaged spectral radiances. The spatial resolution used in the retrieval is typically a coarse grid resolution (e.g 10 10) or zonal (e.g. 10). The temporal resolution is monthly or seasonal. The approach relies on spectral information to separate changes in temperature, humidity, and cloud properties as a function of height. The concept to detect subtle changes in these properties using spectral information is not new and discussed by Goody et al. (1998), Leroy (1998), and Anderson et al. (2004).  Some basic studies to investigate the possibility of average-then-retrieve approach have been done by the Climate Absolute Radiance and Reflectivity Observatory (CLARREO) science definition team. Results using longwave spectral radiances show that clear-sky atmospheric property changes, such as temperature and water vapor amount, can be retrieved from highly-averaged spectral radiance change (Leroy et al. 2008a). However, a larger error occurs in retrieving cloud property (e.g. fraction, height, optical thickness, particle size) changes (Kato et al. 2011). Necessary conditions for the average-then-retrieve approach to work include: 1) Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance change can be expressed as a linear combination of spectral radiance changes caused by cloud and atmospheric properties, 2) the magnitude of spectral radiance changes linearly corresponding to a small perturbation of cloud or atmospheric property, at least in the relevant parts of the spectrum, and 3) changes of cloud and atmospheric properties provide unique spectral radiances that can be separated by a linear regression approach. These assumptions are tested in an earlier study (Kato et al. 2011) and proved to be valid assumptions at least for annual and monthly and 10 zonal scales. 1) and 3) are also shown to be valid at an annual scale also by Leroy et al. (2008a) for clear-sky and by Huang et al. (2010a) for all-sky. Their results also imply that 2) is valid. Similar studies had been done for shortwave spectral radiances by Feldman et al. (2011), Jin et al. (2011), Roberts et al. (2011). One challenge in developing the average-then-retrieve approach is to understand the magnitude and characteristic of retrieval errors. Because temperature, humidity, and cloud property changes are derived from the averaged spectral irradiances, errors in individual properties are not independent. Even if the error in separating the change of cloud properties contribution is large, however, when property changes are retrieved a sufficient number of times, the trend of property changes can be correctly inferred from retrieved properties (Kato et al. 2014). In addition, studies by Weatherhead et al. (1998), Leroy et al. (2008b), and Wielicki et al. (2013) indicate that the requirements for retrieving a trend are: 1) any retrieval bias error must be stable at a level much smaller than that of the trend of interest, and 2) any random error must be sufficiently small with sufficient independent samples to allow accurate detection of the trend. The average-then-retrieve approach can be designed specifically for trend detections but further studies are needed understand the error in order to meet these requirements. In addition, errors are expected to depend on temporal and spatial resolutions. Investigating an optimum resolution is required.  The average-then-retrieve approach requires stable instrument calibrations because calibration drifts directly affect averaged spectral radiances. This is true for retrieve-then-average approaches. However, the average-then-retrieve approach also depends on other conditions in which observations are taken. For example, subtle orbit drifts (e.g. overpass time change for a given location) and viewing zenith angle changes also affect averaged spectral radiances, hence, the result of the average-then-retrieve approach in a more direct way than the result of retrieve-then-average approaches. Therefore, the average-then-retrieve algorithm needs to be developed closely with a team determining instrument requirement of future missions. Application of the average-then-retrieve approach is not limited to future observations. It can be applied to Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, the characteristic of retrieval errors depends on instrument and need to be examined instrument by instrument. Because of this potential broader application of the approach, results of basic research on the average-then-retrieve approach conducted in the future will benefit remote sensing of atmosphere and climate change research communities.

Earthquakes  occur from stick slip motion on faults driven from the far field by plate tectonic motions. NASA’s  geodetic imaging GPS and InSAR measurements provide crustal deformation observations that  are invaluable to understanding active faults. Researchers are increasingly turning to sub-meter  topographic measurements to characterize the morphology of earthquake fault zones. Fault zone  morphology reflects the roughness of faults, which control rupture size, and tectonic stress  orientations. NASA has a long history of measuring the present-day to decadal time scale  deformation associated with fault zones. Earthquake ruptures permanently alter the land surface  and repeated earthquakes cause integrated effects. NASA’s 2002 Solid Earth Science Working  Group Report asks two questions for understanding earthquake hazards, which remain relevant  today:   1. What is the nature of deformation at plate boundaries and what are the implications for earthquake  hazards?   2. How do tectonics and climate interact to shape the Earth’s surface and create natural hazards?  Fault zones result from distributed deformation over repeated earthquakes between two   blocks of crust (Figure 1). Gravity and weather drive surface processes to erode and alter fault  zones further. Tectonic and erosion may operate together creating rock damage and landscape  asymmetry across faults. It is necessary measure the permanent deformation and surface  responses from many earthquakes along recently active faults. Space-based fixed-point observing  provides a means of recovering topography for global active faults with opportunity for on- demand access. Geomorphic metrics computed from surface morphology and simulations allow  scientists to compute relations with earthquake size and shaking hazard.         Figure 1. Faults are made up of a central core surrounded by a damage zone. Key topographic features observable at  the surface provide information about the width of the fault zone, the roughness of the fault, and the orientation of the  fault relative to tectonic motions (artwork Chuck Carter, Jet Propulsion Laboratory).

Landforms along a fault zone express the incremental and cumulative effects of  displacements from earthquakes and the resultant surficial responses to rock damage. Fault  zones are segmented and blocks of different strengths bound the segments. Geodetic imaging  observations are transforming our understanding of earthquake processes by providing  measurement of crustal deformation associated with strain accumulation and release. Seismicity  provides the location and size of events, while geodetic imaging observations provide  observations of surface deformation that reflect tectonic driving motions and response of the  Earth’s crust and earthquake faults. Measurement of fault zone morphology globally would  reveal relationships between fault segment complexity and earthquake ruptures, filling a gap in  measurements that would complement ongoing geodetic, geological, and seismological  observations.   A variety of observational, theoretical and numerical evidence indicates that the roughness of  a fault is directly related to the fault friction and to the control of how earthquakes stop once they  begin to propagate along a fault. Rupture directivity has an impact on ensuing damage from  earthquakes. Fault branches typically form on one side of a fault reflecting the stress field, which  controls the direction of rupture propagation. If the southern San Andreas fault has its overdue  large, M≥7.5 earthquake the basins in the Los Angeles area that form a chain will act as a  waveguide and produce extensive damage. Less damage occurs for a rupture that propagates  southward from the north. Asymmetry across a fault zone indicates rupture directivity, which is  important then for damage assessment.     Figure 2. The trace of the San Andreas fault can be automatically identified from the topography (Hilley et al, 2010).      3        Figure 3. Spectral analysis of topography along the central San Andreas fault (Mustang Ridge) can detect fault zone  structure and shear zone feature spacing and orientations (Delong et al, 2010). Surfaces constructed from fast Fourier  transform filtering of lidar derived DEM draped on original shaded relief maps using different filters. Automatic  anisotropic filtering shows asymmetries with the fault‐parallel features removed.   Measurement of Fault Zone Morphology is Timely and Ready to Inform Earthquake Research  Researchers are automating methods to analyze digital elevation models for understanding   tectonic activity and fault behavior (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Geomorphic metrics quantify  characteristics of the landscape. A variety of geomorphic metrics can be computed and related to  earthquakes. 1 m resolution digital elevation models from lidar along the well-studied San  Jacinto fault show that fault damage can be inferred from changes in drainage patterns across the  fault zone. Fault damage and fault zone complexities are indicators of fault strength. Asymmetry  across the fault zone correlates with rupture propagation direction. Landscapes can be filtered for  patterns and asymmetries.    The planned launch of NISAR in 2020 would allow fusion of deformation and fault zone  morphologic measurements. Topographic measurement of fault zones would be used in the  processing of NISAR data where available. Detailed topographic measurements in California and  the Western United States from the OpenTopography Project serves as a proof-of-concept for  global measurements and provides valuable calibration and validation data.  Space-Based Observations Provide Global, Systematic, and On-Demand Observations   Scientists are increasingly turning to lidar and airborne structure from motion (SfM)  measurements to characterize the morphology of earthquake fault zones. Their essential value is  that they measure topography and surface characteristics at the appropriate fine scale (meter) at  which fault zone deformation processes operate. The measurements are difficult, expensive, and  time consuming to make. While extremely useful, they are not systematic, can have long latency  following earthquakes, and cover small areas. NASA has a long history developing new methods  for studying earthquakes and related natural hazards. The focus has been on geology of fault  zones from spectral imagers such as ASTER and crustal deformation from GPS and radar  measurements. Geomorphic measurements represent the next opportunity for NASA’s  pioneering developments for earthquake research (Figure 4). No other spaceborne mission  provides the capability of producing sub-meter measurement of fault zone morphology.      4     Figure 4. Measuring fault zone morphology requires multi-angle imaging of a target for 3D reconstruction of topography  and determination surface cracking and fault zone damage. Such a system would dwell on a target for minutes during  a pass before moving on to the next target.   Understanding Earthquake Characteristics Mitigates Hazard and Global Measurements Aid  Response   Accurate earthquake probabilities can be computed if synthetic and actual earthquake  histories are consistent. Earthquake simulations model long sequences of earthquakes taking as  parameters fault geometry, crustal deformation velocities, friction along fault segments, and  stress transfer relations. Friction is derived from the assumption that earthquakes rupture with  repeating similar offset patterns called characteristic earthquakes. While this is a convenient  simplifying assumption, observational support for characteristic earthquakes is debated.  Uncertainty in knowledge of characteristic earthquakes for tuning the models and the  simplification of imposing uniform friction along fault segments of tens of kilometers propagate  through the models. Fault segment complexity computed from geomorphic metrics could serve  as a normalized dimensionless proxy for fault friction removing the need to make assumptions  about characteristic earthquakes. Improved assessment of earthquake potential (Figure 5) would  served the estimated 283 million people exposed to major earthquake risk worldwide.   Spaceborne geomorphic measurements could be used to respond to earthquakes that cause  loss of life or property from the earthquake, aftershocks, or induced hazards. Accurate  geographically detailed estimation of damage and risk resulting from disasters is critical for pre- event emergency planning and post-event recovery. Information during the disaster is essential  for emergency planners to allocate resources for response and recovery efforts. Scientifically the  measurements would enable the monitoring of rapid post-seismic response and evolution of fault  zone properties following large ruptures filling a key observational gap. The data will help to  identify processes that occur in close time-space proximity to the occurrence of large earthquake  ruptures.   A mission to measure fault zone morphology would be used by earthquake researchers.  Other fields could also benefit from detailed topographic measurements.      5     Figure 5. Fault zone morphology contributes to earthquake hazard estimation by relating surface patterns to rupture  characteristics. Measurements (orange) couple with and regional and local seismic effects (red) to produce probable  ground motion estimates (gray), which when combined with structural response can be used to estimate damage  probability.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the   spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in  the coming decade?     One of the most pressing contemporary Earth System Science questions is,   incontrovertibly, how will life on Earth respond to climate change over the coming  century?  Global satellite measurements already provide among the greatest insights into  this question by observing how today’s ocean and terrestrial ecosystems respond to  natural, and to some extent anthropogenic forms of climate variation.  However, new and  innovative measurement approaches are required to advance our understanding of the  living Earth System.  Current limitations are particularly acute for studies of ocean  biology, for direct aerosol climate forcing, for cloud-aerosol interactions, and for  precipitation-producing processes.  For example, NASA’s ocean color missions fail to  observe high-latitude ecosystems over much of the annual cycle, yet these climate-critical  ecosystems are experiencing the greatest rate of climate-driven change.  Furthermore,  heritage ocean color sensors only detect the plankton properties in a thin layer of the                                                                                                                                                                         *   This whitepaper response to the 2017 Decadal Survey RFI represents the umbrella of ACE responses for  the mission’s integrated science objectives.  Additional responses to the RFI detailing ACE-related science  questions within the different sub-disciplines are being submitted separately:    1) Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Community Initial Input Towards the Next Decadal Survey.  (Lead author: Anastasia Romanou)   2) Characterizing Aerosol Processes and Properties for Reducing Uncertainties in Aerosol Radiative  Forcing. (Lead author: Richard Ferrare)   3) The Link Between Climate Sensitivity Uncertainty and Understanding Cloud-Aerosol Interactions.

(Lead author:  Gail Skofronick-Jackson)          ocean’s surface, leaving major uncertainties in our understanding of ocean productivity,  biomass distributions, and interactions between biological stocks and rates, and related  physical forcings that will be strongly altered by a changing climate.    Within this grand Earth System Science Challenge of understanding how the  biosphere will respond to climate change are two primary subquestions: (1) How will  these responses of the biosphere feed back on atmospheric factors controlling climate?  and (2) To what extent and where will changes in climate forcing impact the physical  environment in which the biosphere exists?  With respect to this latter subquestion, one  particular uncertainty supersedes all others: aerosol-cloud interactions and the impact of  clouds and aerosols on global radiation, hydrological, and biogeochemical systems.   Indeed, the Executive Summary of Chapter 7 in the 2013 IPCC’s states that “clouds and  aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to estimates and interpretations of  the Earth’s changing energy budget” (p. 573). The underlying issues are further clarified  by noting that “…until sub-grid scale parameterizations of clouds and aerosol–cloud  interactions are able to address these issues, model estimates of aerosol–cloud  interactions and their radiative effects will carry large uncertainties.” (p. 574).   It is also  widely recognized that the treatment of meteorological influences on clouds and aerosols  is an equally important subject that needs to be concurrently addressed.    These outstanding issues from the most recent IPCC assessment point to a series  of unanswered questions regarding the roles of aerosol, clouds, and precipitation in  Earth’s changing climate system.  These questions highlight the continued need for  global observations allowing process studies addressing how the transfer and balance of  energy in a changing climate are influenced by aerosols, clouds, and precipitation, and  how the interactions between aerosols and clouds from their formation through their  transition into precipitation systems influence the response of the Earth system to a  rapidly changing atmosphere and ocean composition.  Thus, to fully understand the threat  that climate change poses to life on Earth in a quantitative manner, it is essential to relate  observed changes in the contemporary biosphere to the magnitude of future change,  which in turn requires process-level understanding of biological feedbacks on climate  along with the details of aerosol-cloud and other interactions of the physical climate  system.   In response to a similar set of questions posed by the Earth Science community,  and recognizing the scientific and observational overlaps in ocean ecosystem and  atmospheric sciences, the 2007 the NRC Decadal Survey recommended the Aerosol- Cloud-Ecosystem (ACE) mission.  At the time, ACE was recommended as a Tier 2, pre- formulation mission focusing on observational requirements to advance understanding of  ocean ecosystems, aerosols, and clouds and their interactions and feedbacks. (NRC  Decadal Survey, 2007, pg. 4-4). As one of its fifteen recommended satellite missions,  ACE represents the primary global mission to advance understanding of the climate- biosphere system. It brings together ecosystem, aerosol, cloud, and other Earth system  scientists in a multiple-sensor, multiple-platform, low sun-synchronous satellite mission.   The recommendation stresses that to achieve mission objectives active (primarily lidars  and radars) and passive sensors need to be combined to observe the Earth at microwave,  infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.   The fundamental science questions that ACE addresses, and the fundamental  approach to addressing those questions, have only come into sharper focus over the     course of the pre-formulation activities.  The mission concept continues to target  collecting synergistic active and passive measurements that will aid understanding of  ocean biological stocks, rates, and changes from pole-to-pole and from the surface to  deep communities, along with the physical processes associated with the Earth’s water  and energy cycles. ACE activities involve participation from a broad segment of the  Earth Science community, in particular from the ocean ecology and biogeochemistry,  aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and radiation disciplines.     Since the ACE mission recommendation by the 2007 Decadal Survey Report, pre- formulation activities have made major advances toward refining its observational and  science requirements.  These developments have resulted in several reports.  Most  recently, the ocean science community has produced a very detailed description of  requirements for the ACE advanced ocean color sensor as part of the Pre-ACE (PACE)  Science Definition Team activities; the PACE Science Definition Team Report is  available from http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/pace-resources.html . In addition, guidance on  numerous ACE-relevant objectives were provided in a recent NASA SMD community  meeting (May, 2014, NASA Ames Research Center); recommendations from this  workshop were published in a report entitled “Outstanding Questions in Atmospheric  Composition, Chemistry, Dynamics, and Radiation for the Coming Decade”, available  from https://espo.nasa.gov/home/content/NASA_SMD_Workshop.   The radiation,  aerosols, clouds, and convections sections of that report highlight questions and possible  observational courses of action that pertain to the roles of aerosols, clouds, precipitation  in the climate system.   The   novel   observational   approaches   attend   to   significant   shortcomings   in   our   present   observational   systems   for   tackling   the   grand   challenges   in   Earth   science   for   the   next   decade.           ACE contribution to Applied Sciences.  ACE also promises to increase the use  of satellite measurements of the ocean-atmosphere system for applications of direct  societal benefit. Improved characterization of aerosol optical depth, aerosol composition  and aerosol height will significantly improve our ability to make informed policy  decisions about air quality and aviation hazards. Science measurements of ocean color  can detect and monitor harmful algal bloom, development of water-quality indices, and  tracking of oil-spills. Applications user communities require products than can be rapidly  delivered to users at a latency, spatial resolution and quality equal to or better than the  Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) . This capability is  needed to enable the generation of time-sensitive products such as the daily air quality or  harmful algal bloom forecasts.  The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) and the  Hurricane Center would benefit from next generation lidar and radar systems that can  provide profiles of volcanic plumes, and storm characteristics, respectively, to inform  public safety policy. Novel ACE observations are critically needed to improve  understanding of ocean processes in Polar Regions and assess impacts of climate change  on high-latitude biodiversity, fisheries, water quality, marine resources, ecosystem health,  and human security. These observations are key to improving ecological forecasts and  planning resource management strategies. ACE will contribute to the short-term  assessment of carbon sources and sinks, knowledge needed to properly manage a carbon  economy and understand impacts and feedbacks of the climate system.      2.   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect     to readiness?       As the only mission identified by the 2007 Decadal Survey to focus on clouds,  aerosols climate, ACE plays a significant role in continuing and extending the   data   record   begun   by   previous   passive   and   active   sensors   in   the   A-­‐Train   and   upcoming   missions   such   as   EarthCARE.         ACE is building upon experience gained from the current  generation of Earth observing satellites, e.g. the NASA Terra, Aqua, TRMM, CloudSat,  CALIPSO, SeaWIFS and GPM platforms. All of these previous missions had as their  principal science objective to characterize the germane properties of the Earth’s  atmosphere and upper ocean. The goals of ACE are different, in that ACE aims not only  to determine what is there, but to delve in more detail into why those properties exist as  they do.  This focus on physical processes distinguishes ACE from its heritage missions  and responds to the science questions that will be pertinent in the coming decade and  beyond.  As such, enhanced coordination among satellite observations, suborbital  measurements, and modeling is a key part of the mission concept.  The ACE mission in  its pre-formulation phase has made significant progress regarding mission requirements  and instrument technical readiness on its way to becoming a fully-fledged free-flyer  mission by using mission resources well.  At the same time, ACE continues to leverage  the advances in technical development and readiness of both instrument concepts (with  support from NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office, ESTO) and their related  algorithm development (with ACE Decadal Survey Study support). The lidar, radar,  polarimeter and ocean sensor technology that comprises ACE’s core measurement suite  is expected to reach a technological readiness level that will permit ACE to go in full  formulation phase by the time the 2017 Decadal Survey Report is published.       3.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these   challenges/questions?    Although airborne and ground-based measurements are essential for calibration and  validation of space-based sensors, for detailed study of isolated events, and to provide  microphysical and chemical detail unobtainable from space, their spatial and temporal  coverage are far from adequate to address the grand challenge of understanding global  climate change and it implications to the biosphere. A comprehensive description of  cloud, aerosol and ocean ecosystem processes, with full statistical and geographical  coverage fundamentally necessitates global, multi-year, space-based observations capable  of elucidating such processes, along with targeted suborbital measurements and models.             ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"richard ferrare::gerald mace::robert swap::ralph kahn::david winker::ali omar::maria tzortziou::"}

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   Observational data show that the Arctic  system experiences dramatic change. Arctic  change is manifest in the atypical behavior of  the NAO (Hurrell & NSIDC, 2013), Arctic  Ocean Oscillation (AOO, Proshutinsky and  Johnson, 1997) and Arctic Oscillation (AO,  Thompson and Wallace, 1998) indices in the  21st century (Proshutinsky et al., 2015). In the  20th century, these indices effectively  characterized the quasi-decadal variability of  the Arctic climate. In particular, 20th century  climatology of the AOO has shown that  anticyclonic and cyclonic regimes of the Arctic  circulation alternate at 5 to 7 year intervals  with a period of oscillation of 10-15 years. In a  stark deviation from this pattern, the present,  21st century the anticyclonic regime has  dominated in the Arctic since 1997 (Fig. 1).    The observed decadal changes in the  Arctic climate were explained in terms of a  feed-back mechanism that involves ocean-sea  ice- atmosphere of the Arctic Ocean and sub- Arctic seas (Proshutinsky et al., 2002;  Dukhovskoy, 2004; 2006a,b). In this  conceptual model, regime shifts are controlled  by atmospheric heat fluxes from the North   Atlantic and freshwater fluxes from the Arctic Ocean.   Of essential importance to our understanding of the evolving Arctic system, and its   impact on the global environment, is to discern the causes and consequences of the  apparent break-down in the natural decadal variability of the Arctic climate. Why has the  well pronounced decadal variability observed in the 20th century been replaced by  relatively weak interannual changes under anticyclonic conditions in the 21st century?   Greenland discharge of meltwater and ice has been accelerating since the early 1990s  (Bamber et al., 2012). Proshutinsky et al. (2015) hypothesized that excess Greenland meltwater  advected into the sub-Arctic seas might have significant impact to deep convection (with  subsequent atmospheric cooling and reduction of cyclonic activity). The authors assume that   Figure 1: Top panels: sea level pressure (black lines,  hPa) and wind typical cyclonic (left) and  anticyclonic regimes (right). Yellow large arrows  show prevailing storm tracks. Bottom panel: Bars  show annual and black line depicts 5-year running  mean AOO index (Proshutinsky and Johnson, 1997,  updated) AOO alternates between anticyclonc (blue  bars) and cyclonic regimes, (red bars) with a period  of 10-14 years while since 1997 a strong anticyclonic  regime has dominated over the Arctic Ocean (from  Proshutinsky et al., 2015).      2     substantial volume of Greenland freshwater spreads into the convective sites of the interior sub- Arctic seas. The effect would be to impede the decadal oscillations that were a feature of the  observations and well-represented by previous studies (Dukhovskoy et al., 2006a,b) prior to the  2000s. This mechanism explaining observed shift of Arctic climate variability into a different  state, suggests different interaction between the Arctic climate system and the global climate. In  the 21st century, global warming impacts the Arctic climate system through accelerated  Greenland freshwater flux, which influences thermohaline processes in the sub-Arctic seas  (similar to the Great Salinity Anomalies (Dickson et al., 1988), air-sea interaction and meridional  heat flux to the Arctic, and ocean and atmospheric processes in the Arctic (Proshutinsky et al.,  2015). this it has been speculated that excess Greenland freshwater flux will eventually disrupts  thermohaline circulation in the sub-Arctic seas shifting Arctic climate system into cold state  (“theromhaline catastrophe”) (Stouffer et al., 2006; Proshutinsky et al., 2015). In addition to this,  one of the consequences of the cessation of Arctic climate variability is persistent accumulation  of freshwater in the Beaufort Gyre that has been shown by in situ  hydrographic observations  (Proshutinsky et al., 2009, 2013) and satellite measurements (Giles et al., 2012). Release of this  excess freshwater from the Beaufort Gyre will cause another Great Salinity Anomaly observed in  the 20s century (Dickson et al., 1988; Belkin et al., 2004). Thus, the Arctic climate system may  feedback to the Global climate system mitigating or even reversing global warming. However,  all suggested and hypothesized mechanisms of Arctic climate change in the 21st century as well  as consequences of these changes for the Global climate need validation and more detailed  analysis. Thus, the key challenges for Earth System Science are:  • What physical processes in the Arctic Ocean – sub-Arctic seas ocean-ice-atmosphere   system are responsible for the observed changes in Arctic climate variability?  • What are the driving mechanisms of climate regime shifts in the Arctic Ocean – GIN   Sea system?  Have these mechanisms changed in the 21st century?  • What will the consequences of the Arctic climate change be for the Global climate   system?  It is clear that we need a far greater understanding of the complex interactions between   components of the Arctic system to predict the rate and magnitude of future Arctic change and  its impact on the Global climate with some confidence. In order to address the above questions,  changes in the components of the Arctic climate system have to be investigated. Some of them  are listed as follows:   1) Ocean:• changes of thermohaline processes and water mass formation in the sub-Arctic  seas and Arctic Ocean; • variability of characteristics of the North Atlantic current; • heat and  freshwater/salt exchange between the Arctic Ocean and sub-Arctic seas.    2) Sea ice: • influence of decreasing sea ice cover on thermohaline processes in the Arctic  Ocean (particularly shelf seas); • relation between deep convection and sea ice cover; • causes  and physical mechanisms driving teleconnection in sea ice conditions in different Arctic and sub- Arctic regions; • role of deep ocean heat (stored in Atlantic and Pacific Waters) in ice change; •  response of sea ice on changes in freshwater content in the upper mixed layer.   3) Atmosphere: • relation between deep convection and air-sea heat fluxes; • relation  between atmospheric circulation and changes ice conditions; • impact of intensified ice melt and  excess freshwater runoff from Greenland on the upper ocean and air-sea heat fluxes; • impact of  change of ice conditions in the Arctic on air-sea heat fluxes and atmospheric heat transport to the  Arctic Ocean.         3     2.  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?   Remote sensing has been provided detailed data about Arctic climate state and its  variability, and new technologies can work with traditional observations to improve our  understand or Arctic change and the impact on climate system. Recent changes in the remote  sensing technology have improved quality and the range of information about sea ice - the key  climate state variable of the Arctic climate. The combination of sea level and gravity (coupled  with Argo) reflect changes in practically all dynamic and thermodynamic processes of terrestrial,  oceanic, atmospheric, and cryospheric origin. There have been two changes in remote sensing  technology that now make these questions feasible to answer.  Furthermore, the rapid change in  ice characteristics, and the related economic impacts (in commerce and local ocean warming  followed by sea level rise) makes this topic highly relevant to society.   Key gaps in understanding are associated with transport of fresh water on the ocean  surface, and air/sea exchanges of energy. New technology exists (space-based microwave  Doppler radar scatterometry) to address transport.  This question requires observations of ocean  surface vector stress (what is commonly called surface vector winds, but is a better fit to stress)  and surface current.  Surface turbulent fluxes are not measured from space, but the capability to  measure the bulk variables (stress, sea surface temperature, near surface moisture, and near  surface air temperature) have been improved to the point where these fluxes can be accurately  calculated from these observations.  The measurement of stress (from scatterometers) removes  the need to know sea state, which in this context is a poorly observed variable (and will likely  continue to be so). Microwave SST observations are needed to penetrate the cloud cover that is  sometimes common in this region. The great breakthroughs are in the measurements of near  surface air temperature and humidity from radiometers (fig. 2).     Figure 2. Validation of satellite retrievals (Bourassa et al. 2010) of humidity at a  height of 10 m above the water surface (left) and air temperature at the same  height (right). The red line is the Jackson and Wick (2010) retrievals, and the red  is the Roberts et al. (2010) retrievals. Both are compared to in situ data from the  ICOADS data set. These retrievals use different input data and very different  techniques, yet they are quite similar.      4      International contributions to improvements in the in situ observing system (Argo floats)  are also expected to improve sub-surface observations in this region, but they are not expected to  be sufficient to address the above issues. However, they will aid in understanding the impact of  the observed transports and surface energy fluxes on the sub-surface ocean.  Observations of  runoff will be useful, as will satellite estimates (from gravity observations) of the change in mass  of the Greenland ice sheet, SST, sea ice, salinity, vector surface stress, and surface currents.   International contributions to scatterometer observations are expected to aid in stress  observations, but fine resolution (~5km grid spacing; 10km resolution) are needed to resolve the  coastal processes and calculate the derivative fields needed to determine ocean upwelling. The  region has highly variable weather conditions, therefore coincident observations of winds (stress)  and currents are highly desirable, such as could be provided by a Doppler scatterometer using  Ka-band to achieve more accurate currents (a factor of 2.7 reduction in uncertainty) relative to  Ku-band) and to achieve the fine resolution needed for the ocean vector stress. The only plan for  a microwave radiometer suitable for measuring SST (which is important for the air temperature  and humidity retrievals) is the Japanese AMSR series, for which there is currently no funded  plan for putting such an instrument in space.     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   Space-based observations are the most effective and are currently the only practical way  to obtain these observations with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. This is a very harsh  region for surface in situ observations. Satellite observations provide necessary information to  monitor and study changes in the state climate variables (sea ice, sea level, ocean wind stress,  surface salinity). Additionally, remote observations of other variables allows one to derive other  crucial information such as air-sea heat fluxes.       References  Bamber, J., M. van den Broeke, J. Ettema, J.

During the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull,  Iceland, ash clouds grounded aircraft for eight days, costing airlines ~US$1.7 billion, with the  cancellation of ~100,000 flights2 affecting 10 million passengers. At a local scale, the June 2014  lava flow erupted at Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, extended 17 km within three months, extending to  within 500 m of the town of Pahoa, resulting in months of uncertainty for residents. The total  cost of this small eruption was ~US$14.5 million, primarily for constructing emergency access  roads. On average, 50 to 60 volcanoes erupt each year3.   Key challenges for the coming decade include predictions of the beginning, and end, of  eruptions, evolution of lava flows, dispersion of volcanic gas and ash clouds, impact on air  quality, and post-eruption hazards such as landslides and mud flows. Timely prediction is  necessary if emergency managers are to formulate effective mitigation strategies in near-real- time.   1. WHAT ARE THE KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE COMING DECADE?   i) FORECASTING WHEN AN ERUPTION WILL BEGIN.   Before an eruption fresh magma moves close to the surface, typically resulting in  precursory seismicity, deformation, and degassing (primarily H2O, CO2, and SO2)4.  Enhanced shallow hydrothermal activity may result, manifesting as thermal,  mineralogical and degassing anomalies at the surface. Excepting earthquakes and  infrasound, these precursory signal can be measured from space (Figure 1). Multi- temporal measurements of their co-variance over multi-annual time scales will allow  the changes that take place as volcanoes worldwide enter periods of heightened unrest  to be determined. A key challenge will be to discriminate the patterns that precede  eruptions (i.e. arrival of lava at the surface) from those that precede failed eruptions  (e.g. magma intrusion at shallow depths with no eruption)4.      ii) FORECASTING WHEN AN ERUPTION WILL END.   During lava-flow forming eruptions, effusion rates typically increase rapidly to a  peak, and then wane over a longer period of time until the eruption ends5. During  these eruptions, and those that produce lava domes, gas emission rates also decrease  as supply of fresh magma from depth wanes. Dome-forming eruptions may last years,  making long-term measurements of lava effusion and gas emission rates essential for  recognizing secular declines. Determining how satellite measurements of effusion  rate6 and degassing7 (combined with models of volcanic behavior8) can be used to  predict eruption cessation is an important challenge. Space-based deformation     measurements will provide an important constraint from which partitioning of magma  and lava between the surface and the subsurface can be constrained.     iii) PREDICTING VOLCANIC HAZARDS, AND MAKING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO  DECISION MAKERS IN NEAR-REAL-TIME.   Mitigating volcanic hazards to aviation: Recent advances in ash transport and  dispersion modeling have combined remote sensing estimates of mass concentration  with models of the physico-chemical evolution of ash9 and meteorological models.  Key challenges include incorporating variations in ash composition, size, and shape  into the estimates of mass loading, and validating ash retrievals, to predict the time- space evolution of ash clouds, and the concentration of ash at each point in space.  Collaborations with the aerospace sector are required to define tolerable thresholds  for safe flight.    Mitigating lava flow hazards: It is important to forecast which areas downslope are  likely to be inundated by lava flows and their time-rate of advance. A key challenge is  to predict these quantities for long-duration eruptions, where multiple flow units can  advance during the same eruption, in response to changes in the mass flux driving  flow propagation. Effusion rate is a key variable in parameterizing numerical lava  flow simulations10, and can be estimated from space.    Mitigating health effects of persistent degassing: SO2 is converted to (respirable)  aerosol as it moves from the vent. A challenge is quantifying how efficiently (and  under what environmental conditions), this conversion takes place11, such that  atmospheric dispersion models can more accurately predict aerosol pollution,  allowing health professionals to monitor for its effects and target mediation efforts.  The societal benefit of meeting these challenges is obvious. Mitigating these hazards  requires rapid delivery of information to decision makers. Satellite data must be  available within hours of overpass (via direct broadcast), in a format (or via a well- considered suite of higher level data products) that decision makers can utilize.  Onboard processing and product generation will minimize the time between data  acquisition and product delivery.      iv) HOW HAZARDOUS ARE VOLCANOES THAT SHOW NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF ACTIVITY?  Populations will increase around dangerous volcanoes that are dormant, or have no  record of activity. Volcanic landslide hazards can be identified by mapping the  surface expression (e.g. hydrothermal alteration) of structural weaknesses.  Unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits can be remobilized by water, forming mud flows.  Mapping the distribution of such deposits (in relation to topography) is a prerequisite  for their hazard evaluation, and can be expedited using satellite remote sensing12.       v) HOW DOES GLOBAL VOLCANISM PERTURB THE EARTH SYSTEM? Subtle changes in   ecosystems are increasingly used as metrics of environmental change. What subtle  effects do volcanic gas emissions have on landscapes at local and regional scales?13  Large eruptions can influence climate on sub-decadal time scales, by perturbing  Earth’s radiative balance, and lowering global temperatures, countering the role that  anthropogenic greenhouse emissions play as agents of warming. Recent research has  suggested that a gradual increase in stratospheric aerosol loading since 2002 is the  result of smaller tropical eruptions, not coal burning in Asia, as previously thought14.  It is important to determine the magnitude of the volcanic forcing, to quantify its  relative contribution to the global climate system.     2. WHY IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND WHY ARE SATELLITE  OBSERVATIONS FUNDAMENTAL TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS?   Addressing these challenges is timely. Earth’s population is increasingly vulnerable to  volcanic hazards. Encroachment into areas vulnerable to eruptions is pronounced in emerging  nations, where in-situ monitoring networks are still lacking4. Economic systems and  infrastructure are integrated as never before, but have low resiliency to disturbances: reducing  the uncertainties associated with eruptions is increasingly important, as they can have regional  and global consequences. Computational models that seek to predict volcanic behavior have  increased enormously in complexity and capability15, and require ever increasing volumes of  data that space-based technologies are now well placed to provide.    Satellite observations are fundamental to meeting these challenges as they can provide  measurements of key eruption variables, with uniform fidelity, for all volcanoes on Earth,  encompassing all eruption styles and their temporal variability. Furthermore, volcanic processes  are dynamic and decision-makers require data in near-real-time; satellites, via direct broadcast  (and onboard processing) can provide this information for eruptions anywhere on Earth. The  concept of a space-based volcano observatory may even be realizable in the near future. Systems  that use low spatial but high temporal resolution satellite sensors to autonomously re-task higher  spatial (but lower temporal) resolution sensors already exist16. Integrating more space-based  sensors into these systems, to maximize the amount of important data acquired during often  short-lived eruptions, is both an opportunity and a challenge. The proliferation of UAVs and  autonomous in-situ technologies will allow more complete validation of satellite measurements  (and integration, via “sensor-webs”) than ever before, enhancing their collective value.      With respect to meeting the challenges identified, InSAR measures deformation, and current  and proposed SAR missions (e.g. NISAR) will provide these measurements. However, no global  mapping mission is in operation (or development) that will provide measurements in the 0.3 to  14 m range needed to meet the challenges identified. Volcanic aerosols (and CO2)17 can be     quantified using hyperspectral visible-to-short-wave infra-red (VIS-SWIR) measurements. Lava  flow cooling18 and effusion rates6 can be quantified using SWIR and mid-wave infra-red (3-5  m) measurements (the high temperatures require that these measurements resist saturation19).  SO2 and ash can be quantified using long-wave infrared (LWIR, 7-14 m) data20, (although  retrievals benefit from simultaneous hyperspectral VIS-SWIR measurements, for atmospheric  correction). LWIR measurements allow the composition and texture of rocks to be determined  using measurements of their temperature and emissivity21, and provide precise measurements of  the temperature of low temperature hydrothermal systems.   Space-based systems upon which volcanologists rely are beyond their planned mission  lifetimes. While progress has been made in quantifying volcanic behavior from space,  volcanologists have had to cede spatial and spectral detail to buy higher temporal sampling, or  vice versa. A future challenge for observing volcanism from space is to bridge this gap,  providing data with sufficient spatial resolution to resolve, for example, crater lakes <100 m in  diameter, at the wavelengths described in the preceding paragraphs, and at the high temporal  resolutions (and duty cycle) required to study dynamic volcanic phenomena across the globe.  Current technologies allow for acquisition of high spatial resolution data (<100 m), between 0.3- 14 m, for the entire globe, night and day, at temporal resolutions of less than one week.   3. WHICH SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES WILL BE INVOLVE IN MEETING THESE CHALLENGES   Meeting these challenges will involve interactions between geologists, physicists, chemists  (geochemists and atmospheric chemists), atmospheric scientists (particularly dispersion  modelers), computer scientists, and mathematicians.

Principal Author:  Tristan S. L’Ecuyer, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,   University of Wisconsin-Madison  Co-author:   Steven A. Ackerman, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences   and Space Science and Engineering Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison    Narrative of White Paper:    1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   Much of the remaining uncertainty in future climate projections can be traced to an inadequate  representation of the cycling of water through Earth’s atmosphere through the critical series of  processes that couple the hydrological and energy cycles of our planet.  Of particular importance  are the processes that govern the formation and maintenance of cloud systems and the resultant  precipitation that supplies the fresh water that sustains life on Earth.  These cloud and  precipitation processes act over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales. Representing the  accumulated impacts of local-scale processes on the large-scale climate system poses a  significant unresolved challenge in climate modeling, which is clearly illustrated by the large  discrepancies in ice water path and precipitation distributions derived from various GCM model  simulations.    These differences arise from the varied approximations used to represent the microphysical and  macrophysical properties of ice clouds in each model.  The underlying lack of knowledge of ice  cloud processes responsible for these discrepancies is evident in the wide range of ice masses  and precipitation efficiencies among cloud resolving models (CRMs). Cloud simulations by  models participating in the GCSS WG 2 Idealized Cirrus Model Comparison Project, for  example, span more than an order of magnitude across state-of-the-art CRMs while the use of  different ice microphysics schemes in a single CRM can change rainfall accumulations by a  factor of two or more the simulation of a continental convection.    The fact that models produce widely varying ice contents has little more than academic relevance  if the climate is not sensitive to ice cloud processes.  However, ice clouds dominate the radiative  energy budget of regions where they are present and play a key role in precipitation processes.   As a result, modern climate models exhibit significant variability in the strengths of cloud  feedbacks leading to a wide range in their predicted climates.  Even more disturbing from a  societal perspective is the fact that models disagree on the extent to which precipitation patterns  may respond in a future climate.  Narrowing the spread in cloud feedback and precipitation     distributions in models will require accurate representation of the full spectrum of ice-phase  precipitation processes across the varied environments around the globe.     A key challenge for improving the predictive capabilities of global climate models is accurately  parameterizing the coupled radiative and hydrologic impacts of the complete spectrum of  precipitation systems around the globe.  While observations have, to some extent, been used to  identify model deficiencies such as a precipitation intensity distribution that is skewed toward  light rain, an under-representation of the diurnal cycle of convection, and significant under- estimation of the magnitude of cloud radiative effects in the southern oceans, observations to  date do not provide sufficient information to directly improve model representations of the  underlying physical processes.  This stems, in part, from the fact that current observations do not  have the needed accuracy to resolve inter-model differences in ice water path.  In addition,  current observing systems fail to provide the explicit measure of in-cloud dynamics required to  connect model biases to the physical processes that govern linkages between the Earth’s energy  and water cycles.    In the coming decade, the challenge of improving the representation of ice-phase processes in  global models can, however, be met through coordinated deployment of advanced active and  passive satellite instrumentation that have been realized through NASA science and technology  investments.  Simultaneous observation of the integrated ice mass, its vertical structure, and  small-scale vertical motions in the convective, stratiform, and non-precipitating anvil regions of  global precipitation systems would satisfy the need for measurements to directly influence the  development of improved parameterizations of ice processes in global models. All of these  quantities can be measured with current space-ready technologies enabling a new paradigm for  improving climate prediction through Earth observation.    To interface with climate model parameterizations, observations are required at the cloud- process-resolving scale and must exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial sampling to distinguish  different cloud morphologies and meteorological processes.  Of particular importance to climate  prediction is quantifying the contributions to upper tropospheric ice production from deep  convection as opposed to synoptic lifting.  Such a classification would enable the development  and testing of new self-consistent representations of ice cloud processes and cloud systems.   Similarly, the rates of ice fallout control how much condensate remains in the air relative to that  which falls to the ground as precipitation or is evaporated in the intervening atmosphere. Small  changes to ice particle fall speed parameterizations can substantially modify model climates, by  modifying the upper tropospheric water and radiation budgets.  Reducing uncertainties in  modeled fall speeds through direct measurements can, therefore, significantly improve the  representation of cloud cover and radiative cooling in the atmosphere and, by extension,  precipitation since atmospheric radiative cooling is directly connected to precipitation through  energy balance constraints.    Progress in improving the representation of cloud processes in climate models requires close  coordination of the cloud and precipitation remote sensing and climate modeling communities.  Observations provide the essential data sets to test the models’ representation of processes, while  models are used to diagnose processes in great detail and quantify feedbacks. It is expected that  the implementation of improved parameterizations facilitated by these new satellite observations     will significantly reduce uncertainties in climate predictions on both global and regional scales,  and, in turn, provide better projections of impacts on water availability to policy makers.    2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?   There is a pressing need for a mission dedicated to observing cloud and precipitation processes.   Radar and sub-millimeter radiometer technologies have advanced significantly since the last  Decadal Survey and have demonstrated the capability to acquire the necessary observations.    Likewise, increases in computing power can be expected to reach the point where global models  can resolve scales of relevance to individual convective cores.  Important advances in the  representation of moist physical processes are required to allow models to operate on such  scales.    The NASA Earth Science Weather Focus Area hosted a community workshop in April 2015 to  produce a report examining the scientific challenges and opportunities in NASA related weather  research.  The 70 invited participants in attendance, that included individuals from government  agencies, academia, the private sector, and other national and international organizations  suggested that one of the key questions NASA should seek to address is: What processes  determine cloud microphysical properties (ice clouds in particular) and their connections to  aerosols and precipitation?  Furthermore, to address this question the panel noted a need for  “observational estimates of the vertical velocity within convective systems...”    No current or planned observing system addresses the need for simultaneous measurements of  ice water path and vertical motion at the scales required to isolate convective processes.  Such  observations require a combination of vertical profiling through the cloud system with  complementary column-integrated constraint with broader spatial coverage that can only be  provided by a multi-frequency Doppler radar and a sub-millimeter radiometer.  The only planned  international mission with related technology is the European EarthCARE mission that aims to  provide the first measurements of Doppler velocity from space.  However the target 1 ms-1  Doppler accuracy of the EarthCARE radar at an along-track resolution of 10 km is far too coarse  to resolve convective processes and the strong attenuation and multiple scattering encountered at  W-band limits its utility in strong convection.  The Decadal Survey should, therefore, strongly  recommend that NASA pursue a mission for addressing cloud processes through simultaneous  measurements of ice mass and vertical motion.  A majority of the instrument design challenges  associated with the required technologies have been addressed through recent NASA technology  development investment. We suggest that by leveraging an appropriate combination of the  resulting assets, NASA is poised to push the frontiers of improving climate predictability through  Earth observation through a mission dedicated to assessing ice processes directly.       3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?    From the deep convective towers that transport vast quantities of heat vertically in the west  Pacific to the isolated trade cumuli that dot the tropical transition zones to the organized  mesoscale convective systems that produce flooding rains at midlatitudes the character of     convection varies widely across the globe.  Responses in the lifetime, spatial coverage,  precipitation yield from any of these cloud regimes can exert significant influences on the  climate system.  It is, therefore, not sufficient to develop models that address only one or two  properties of convection in selected regions.  Given the highly variable nature of convective  cloud processes, space based global observations are the only approach for realizing the  advanced understanding of the full spectrum of convection around the globe that is required to  advance climate model prediction in the coming decades.  No previous satellite mission has been  designed specifically to connect accurate measurements of vertically integrated ice mass, in- cloud vertical motion, and precipitation.  There is a critical need for such observations to inform  the development of new parameterizations of ice cloud-precipitation processes in global models.        ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"steven ackerman::"}

This topic was voted as the top priority for atmospheric composition by the attendees of the workshop, demonstrating broad community support for future research on this issue.    Global population is expected to increase from ~7 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050 with most of the increase occurring in the developing world, including over half in Africa.  Today, many of the world’s megacities (>10 million population) exist in the developing world and their global number is expected to increase from 22 currently to 36 by 2050.  Air pollution, particularly in the developing world, is already the single largest environmental health risk, claiming 7 million lives annually (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/).  Extreme pollution events in China and India are often reported by the media, but they also occur frequently in large cities of the Middle East, Africa, South America, and other Asian countries (Zhu et al., 2012).  Major sources of air pollution in the developing world include motor vehicles, burning of household waste, domestic fuel (charcoal, wood, agricultural waste, dung), electricity generation, industry, and unpaved roads.  Naturally occurring aerosols (e.g., dust) are another regionally important contributor to air quality issues. In addition, urban populations can be strongly affected by large-scale biomass burning on a seasonal basis.  Megacities have large energy consumption and are concentrated sources of both pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  The air pollution created from these activities causes detrimental health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Many of the tropical and subtropical megacities exceed the WHO annual mean guidelines for PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations and exceed national and WHO standards for ozone.   Observations are needed to answer the following questions: - What is the current (i.e., baseline) impact of anthropogenic activities and natural emissions on urban air quality, tropospheric composition, and climate? - How will emissions of trace gases, greenhouse gases, and aerosols change over the coming decades from urbanization, economic development, and policy decisions? - To what extent does biomass burning pollution affect megacity air quality and how will these emissions change in response to population growth in the developing world? - What will be the effects of population growth and spatial distribution on weather and climate (aerosol radiative forcing, temperature and water vapor changes, etc.)?   Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Most of the population growth in the coming decades will be in urban areas of developing countries, thereby deteriorating air quality.  For example, Liousse et al. (2014) estimate that ~50% of global organic carbon emissions of particulate matter could be from Africa by 2030.  Air quality will be monitored hourly by satellite over much of the heavily populated regions of the Northern Hemisphere by the geostationary constellation of TEMPO, Sentinel 4 and GEMS by ~2019.  However, this constellation will not cover Central and South America, much of Africa, and parts of the Middle East and South Asia -- regions with expected explosive population growth and air quality degradation.  Therefore without additional space-borne instruments, fine-resolution diurnal measurements of air quality in the tropics and subtropics will not be possible.  The ability to monitor air quality and changing emission patterns from space has been proven from low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites such as Aura, Aqua, Terra, ENVISAT, and METOP.  UV-Vis and IR instruments on these platforms have demonstrated ability to monitor NO2, HCHO, SO2, CO, (CHO)2, and aerosols.  However, near-surface ozone monitoring will require simultaneous UV/Vis/TIR observations on new platforms.  To understand contributions of various emission sources will require finer spatial and temporal resolution than is provided by the current LEO instruments.  The LEO Sentinel 5P TROPOMI instrument due to be launched in 2016 will provide 7-km horizontal resolution, but will still only provide one observation per day.  Such data will be insufficient to better understand the chemical processing that occurs in the diurnal evolution of ozone and in the buildup of aerosol loading. To ensure that major urban areas are sufficiently sampled every day, geostationary observations are required. The necessary instrument technology exists to perform these observations.  Alpert et al. (2012) have examined trends in AOD over the world’s largest cities using data from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and MISR over the period 2002 – 2010.  AOD in large cities in West Africa show upward trends from all three sensors.  In some major cities of South America there is disagreement between the sensors in terms of the direction of the trend, leaving considerable uncertainty concerning air quality trends for aerosols.  Duncan et al. (2015) computed the trends in NO2 over 2005 to 2014 for a number of cities worldwide as measured by OMI on the Aura satellite.  Figure 1 shows the percentage change in tropospheric NO2 column amounts over this period for three African cities (Cairo, Nairobi, and Luanda).  Strong positive trends are detected in each of these metropolitan areas, demonstrating the effects of explosive population growth and economic development in these regions.  These trends urgently call for more comprehensive monitoring of air quality in the developing world in the near future.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Most tropical and subtropical cities lack continuous, sustained air quality monitoring at surface sites, and while there are more measurements available from South American cities, the reliability and accessibility of the data are less than desired.  Therefore, geostationary satellite observations are required to estimate air quality levels throughout the day such that pollution warnings can be issued.  Suborbital observations would clearly aid in establishing baseline data.  One or two prototype urban areas should be selected for intensive sampling.  Perhaps an international consensus concerning needed suborbital and surface field programs would be required before such experiments could be conducted.  International partners would also likely         Figure 1.   OMI tropospheric column NO2 trends over 2005 to 2014 for Cairo (upper left), Nairobi (upper right), and Luanda (lower left).  Gray values indicate no significant trend.  be desirable in conducting such measurements.  Suborbital research should also contain components that examine impacts of biomass fires on air quality and on GHG emissions, in addition to urban impacts.  The existing and planned LEO instruments provide at best one or two observations per day.  This limited temporal coverage limits characterization of pollution sources on diurnal scales and limits the determination of pollutant transport and spatial variability.  Clouds are a hindrance to polar orbiting observations during the wet season.  Hourly observations from a geostationary platform increase the probability of obtaining cloud-free scenes.  Many of the existing instruments are approaching the ends of their lifetimes.  Therefore: · Geostationary UV/VIS/NIR/TIR observations are needed over the tropics and subtropics to measure hourly O3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, CO, CH4, (CHO)2, NH3, and AOD with sufficient sensitivity to the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere for air quality application. · To cover the major population centers of the tropics and subtropics that will not be observed by the currently planned constellation, observations are needed over the latitude range of 15°N to 35°S and longitude range of 80°W to 75°E.  This is a region of dimensions 50° of latitude by 155° of longitude, requiring two geostationary platforms and international collaboration. · NASA and USAID collaborate on making satellite products available in developing countries under the SERVIR program.  SERVIR should be expanded to include air quality applications.  Summary  The population explosion over the next few decades will primarily impact the tropics and subtropics.   The planned geostationary view of major gaseous pollutants misses many of the tropical and subtropical megacities and near megacities (particularly in South America and Africa).  Emissions and relative source contributions of pollutants affecting air quality in these cities are very poorly known.  Therefore, geostationary instruments focused on the tropics and subtropics are needed.  In addition, there is a need for surface and aircraft measurements to derive today’s baseline emissions and air quality in the fast-growing population centers of the tropical and subtropical developing world.  The impacts of biomass burning and dust on urban air quality, the interactions of pollution with the aerosol-cloud-radiation environment, and long-range transport must be quantified.  Air quality in these regions is closely linked with land-use changes and the hydrological cycle.  Therefore, atmospheric composition measurements in this region should be accomplished in conjunction with studies of land-use change, cloud-aerosol interaction, and greenhouse gas emissions.   In the near-term there is a need for suborbital observations to establish baseline tropical megacity atmospheric composition, sources, and regional impacts in conjunction with ground stations and modeling.  In the longer-term, geostationary satellite observations of atmospheric composition over the tropics and subtropics are needed for reactive gases, aerosols, and longer-lived species such as CO and methane as an aid in predicting severe air quality events, as well as for gaining insight on the diurnal emission patterns and chemical processing occurring in each megacity.

In just 10 years, from 2004 to 2013, the United States suffered 3500 fatalities and $500B in  economic losses from hurricanes and severe storms. New storm-penetrating observations are  urgently needed to improve our nation’s capability to predict the path and intensity of these extreme  weather events, to give people enough time to safeguard property and get out of harm’s way.  Convective storms in particular, such as tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective systems (i.e.  large thunderstorm complexes), and extratropical cyclones (typically, large midlatitude winter  storms) need urgent attention. Monsoons and atmospheric rivers – systems that play a large role  in transporting water from oceans to continents – are also in this category. Such storms can  undergo very rapid and unexpected intensification and have the potential for causing great harm  to life and property from wind, floods and related hazards.     Although we have made great progress in predicting the tracks of such storms (but still not  well enough), predicting intensity is still a major challenge. There are many recent examples of  that. Improved track forecasts are likely the result of significant progress in recent years in  observing, modeling and predicting global circulation, but intensity forecasts are thought to lag  behind because the models do not capture storm-scale convective processes well nor the  underlying microphysics. The modeling of convection is a particular problem that must be  addressed.     The problem of severe storms may be growing as a consequence of climate change. While  there is in general a strong need to address near-term climate consequences that affect society,  from people’s daily lives to the economic activities of nations, severe storms are a particularly  threatening consequence. We have an inadequate understanding of the underlying earth system  processes in many such “applications” areas, which results in poor predictions. We must  therefore carry out research, based on observations, to improve our understanding of the  processes, which will in turn lead to better models and predictions. This approach should  urgently be applied to the key science questions around severe storms, such as the ones identified  by a recent NASA Weather workshop:   • How do convective-scale and large-scale circulations interact?  • What determines the mesoscale organization, internal structure and dynamics, and life   cycle of convective systems?  • What modulates the rate at which convective storms (of all types) intensify to produce   severe weather, tornadic storms, lightning, and other hazards?     • What processes and interactions control the type, onset, rate, and accumulation of  precipitation?      We need good observations of a) storm-scale macro-physical moist thermodynamic processes,  b) sub-stormscale macro- and micro-physical processes, and c) interactions between storm-scale,  mesoscale and large-scale processes. These observations need to be made simultaneously, under  all weather conditions, in full context and continuously, covering all phases of a storm’s life  cycle in three dimensions. It is not sufficient to observe “snippets” of limited aspects of storms  and stitch them together from an ensemble of case studies – at least not until we have a clear  understanding of how the “cases” may be separable. Above all, the observations must be valid in  all weather conditions, i.e. in the presence of full cloud cover and precipitation.     The key variables are i) thermodynamics (temperature and water vapor profiles), ii) water  phase and phase transitions (cloud liquid and ice, evaporation, condensation and precipitation),  iii) dynamics (horizontal and vertical wind vectors, and iv) microphysics (hydrometeor particle  size/shape/distribution) – all continuously with high temporal resolution and in 3 dimensions.  We must be able to determine both horizontal and vertical transport of mass, momentum, and  latent and sensible heat, as well as their rates of change.    Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?     Many projected or hypothesized climate change consequences are at the threshold of  detectability with current or near-mature observing technology and capabilities, and focusing on  them now may give society enough time to adapt or mitigate. This is the case with severe storms,  which are predicted to become more intense as a consequence of a warming climate. In particular,  the predicted intensification or speedup of the hydrologic cycle may lead to more intense and  possibly more frequent convective storms. It has become clear in recent years that vulnerability  to such storms has grown, both because of societal trends and because of effects related to  known climate change (e.g., sea level rise). This is therefore a particularly timely and urgent  challenge.     Increased efforts in observing, understanding, modeling and predicting severe convective  storms are therefore urgently needed, and this need will only grow more urgent over time. Severe  storms affect nearly all applications areas, from agriculture to transportation to security – with  consequences spreading from local to regional to national and global.  In the last decadal survey  nearly 10 years ago this was already recognized as a priority, when the NRC recommended the  PATH mission, a geostationary microwave sounder to be focused on tropical cyclones and  severe storms, and it is arguably even more urgent and timely now.     NASA has invested significantly to mature the technology required for PATH. This  development has now been successfully completed, and, as a result, a PATH mission is ready to  be implemented at this time. PATH will have the  capability to measure all key storm parameters at  storm-scale and above, except for vertical  velocity and microphysics. Despite these two  gaps, just a single geostationary microwave  sounder, operating in conjunction with existing  sensors in a multi-sensor/multi-platform virtual  constellation, will lead to rapid progress in the  science of severe storms - observing,  understanding, modeling and predicting.

We also note that a geostationary sensor will provide real-time nowcasting  capabilities, and important addition to disaster response planning and resource management.     Other future storm sensor systems are being explored but do not have the level of readiness  that PATH now has.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?     Severe storms are currently not well sampled. That is because they typically are narrowly  concentrated in time and space, i.e. evolving and moving rapidly and spatially highly  heterogeneous. Ground based observing systems are not dense enough or capable enough to  capture key processes. This is especially true in ocean areas, where many severe storms (e.g.,  tropical and extratropical cyclones) develop and intensify. And it is nearly impossible to have  mobile observing systems (e.g., field campaigns) positioned at the right time and place. Although  it is possible to accumulate enough “coincident” data from such sources to build statistical  models, the great variety of processes, interacting at multiple scales, that determine the evolution  of individual storms cannot be modeled from such statistics. Rather, it is necessary to observe the  entire individual life cycle of constituent storm processes, storm elements and storm systems to  gain a full understanding that can be incorporated into high fidelity models that are valid under  all circumstances. Doing so is only possible from space.      ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"ali behrangi::eric fetzer::svetla hristova-veleva::brian kahn::hui su::baijun tian::joe turk::"}

In particular, observations showed a positive trend in stratospheric aerosol loading of 4 – 7% per year for the decade following the year 2000, despite a lack of increased input to the stratosphere from any major volcanic eruptions (e.g., the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, which led to a two-order of magnitude increase in the stratospheric aerosol burden).  At a global scale, this increase of the stratospheric aerosol burden was mainly caused by a series of moderately sized volcanic eruptions occurring at high northern latitudes.  Anthropogenic pollution sources, however, can contribute to changes in the regional loading (e.g., over the Asian monsoon region), and large wildfires contribute a so-far unquantified input. Regardless of the source of this increased stratospheric aerosol burden, these particles are primarily scattering and their radiative effects have resulted in a global cooling that offset about 1/3 of the warming expected from increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) over the same time period.    These increases in stratospheric aerosol loading were neglected by the climate models contributing to the last IPCC report, suggesting these models might, if anything, be underestimating the warming associated with increasing greenhouse gases. Synthesizing observations of stratospheric aerosol to include their effects in climate models is thus a priority for the Earth science community.  Given the lack of observations, appropriately accounting for the properties of these aerosols is challenge.  The sizes, composition, and optical properties of naturally occurring background stratospheric aerosols such as carbonyl sulfide are different from particles that result from anthropogenic sources or injections from wildfires (e.g., carbonaceous aerosols).  Furthermore, inputs of sulfur dioxide directly into the stratosphere from volcanic eruptions are known to perturb the particle size of the stratospheric aerosol layer, which changes the mass scattering efficiency—and so the cooling—caused by these particles.  Uncertainties in particle sizes and composition of the stratospheric aerosol layer, and how those properties change as the aerosol load is perturbed, are thus a key impediment to appropriately including the radiative effects of these particles in climate models.  Finally, while the above discussion has focused on natural and inadvertent anthropogenic perturbations to the stratospheric aerosol layer, consideration must be given to proposals to deliberately engineer climate to offset global warming by changing the loading or size and composition of the stratospheric particles in a Solar Radiation Management (SRM) program.  Detection, attribution, and efficacy of such efforts require not only monitoring but also a proper characterization of the prior state of the aerosol layer.  Furthermore, as such scenarios are being explored in climate models, it has become apparent that the models themselves have a wide diversity of results even for a commonly prescribed perturbation.  Issues of transport and aerosol size and composition in models, which can potentially be resolved by bringing more observations to bear on the problem, must be addressed before these models are used to make any quantitative statement about a possible geoengineering program.  There is an immediate need to better understand the stratospheric aerosol.  As discussed above, the background loading of the stratospheric aerosol appears to be anything but constant, and the increases in the stratospheric aerosol optical depth over recent years are evidently offsetting some of the warming expected from increases in GHGs.  This is happening now.  Less well known is how these changes in the stratospheric aerosol layer are affecting the specific microphysical and optical properties of the aerosol, and therefore their climate effects.  The need to characterize the changes in the stratospheric aerosol layer and monitoring the climate response to its variations argues for a robust observing system, including satellite observations for spatial and temporal coverage, and ground-based and airborne observations for calibration and validation.  The timeliness argument is bolstered by the need to precisely constrain the anthropogenic contributions to global temperature change, as well as current consideration of geo-engineering scenarios.  Satellite observations are absolutely vital to improving our understanding of stratospheric aerosols.  Stratospheric aerosols are inhomogeneously distributed in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and their distributions can be dramatically impacted by impulsive events such as volcanic eruptions.  The effects of perturbations evolve in a complex way from a possibly highly localized origin, over time scales ranging from a few hours to many months.  Satellite measurements with global spatial coverage and high vertical resolution are necessary to adequately monitor this evolution.    A long record of observation exists from instruments viewing the Earth’s limb.  Historically, high vertical resolution observations have been obtained from sensors such as the SAGE and POAM series that make solar occultation measurements (i.e., observing sunrise and sunset over the Earth’s limb).  These observations are self-calibrating, high precision extinction measurements that obtain vertical resolutions of approximately 1 km, but have limited spatial sampling because they see only a single sunrise and sunset pair per orbit.  By contrast, limb scattering measurements obtain a much greater sampling density because observations can be made continuously throughout the satellite orbit.  Limb-scattering instruments such as SCIAMACHY on Envisat, OSIRIS on Odin, and OMPS LP on Suomi NPP have 2 km vertical resolution with near daily global sampling (along a single or perhaps several curtains per orbit).  Scattering measurements require a retrieval that assumes some properties of the aerosol observed, but increased spectral coverage can result in better constraints on these assumptions.  An important factor in designing a limb scattering observing system is that the scattered radiance signal observed from space will have a strong angular dependence due to variations in the aerosol particle scattering phase function (i.e., angular distribution of scattered light, dependent on particle size and composition).  OMPS LP, for example, views the limb behind the satellite orbit trajectory and, because of its viewing geometry, has a view angle sensitivity that is a strong function of the observation latitude. The result is a relatively higher sensitivity to aerosols in the northern than southern hemisphere.   We propose a small satellite constellation for Global Aerosol Monitoring of the Stratosphere (GAMS).  GAMS will build off the OMPS LP heritage, but will realize several advantages over the present design.  Forward and rearward looking observation slits will disentangle the view angle sensitivity discussed above, since in each orbit the same scenes will be observed under both forward and backscattering directions.  Adding off-axis slits (looking to the side of the satellite trajectory) would increase spatial coverage, which can alternatively be realized by flying multiple copies of the basic 2-slit instrument in orbits with different local equator crossing times.  The notional GAMS observing concept is illustrated in the Figure.  Wavelength selection is simplified by using one or more narrow band spectral filters for each slit.  Wavelengths in the visible and near-IR region, such as 675 nm, provide the information needed for aerosol characterization.  Using additional aerosol wavelengths would depend on the results of scientific and engineering trade studies.  Separate measurements at a near-UV wavelength such as 350 nm will provide altitude registration using the vertical dependence of the Rayleigh scattered radiance profile.  Simple linear CCDs can provide improved vertical sampling (< 0.5 km) for each slit, while measuring the entire altitude range of interest simultaneously.  The upper portion of the figure shows a side view of the GAMS optical system.  The small images on each side represent a nominal view of the Earth’s limb, with brighter signals near the surface.  The white rectangle indicates the detector surface. The lower portion of the figure shows a view of the detector surface from above.  Each blue line represents the vertical image from a single slit, with high altitude (faint) signals towards the center and low altitude (bright) signals towards the outside.     The GAMS design is configured towards low-cost flight opportunities, such as CubeSats, that offer both frequent availability and different orbit options.  Initial development of the GAMS design is currently being supported by a recently awarded NASA GSFC internal grant.  Continued development of this design towards a flight-ready demonstration system would require additional investment through competitively awarded or directed funding.  This development effort also takes advantage of the synergy with the extensive aerosol-climate modeling program at GSFC, a key component of the mission design.  Such models are a natural beneficiary of the proposed measurements, as the increased frequency and density of observations provides improved constraints to refine the physical mechanisms incorporated in the models.  At the moment, the only operating limb-scattering instruments are OMPS LP, launched in 2011, and OSIRIS, launched in 2001. The other sensors discussed in this white paper are no longer operational.  A SAGE III instrument will deploy to the ISS beginning in 2016, and a follow-on OMPS LP instrument is planned to fly on JPSS 2 with a planned launched date of 2022.  Developing GAMS ensures a source of critical stratospheric aerosol measurements to bridge any potential gap between SAGE III and JPSS-2, as well as complementing continued OMPS LP observations under the JPSS program.

 Assimilation   Working   Group    Correspondence   to:   Q.   Errera   (quentin.errera@aeronomie.be)        SPARC   (Stratosphere-­‐troposphere   Processes   And   their   Role   in   Climate)   is   one   of   the   core   projects   of    the   World   Climate   Research   Program   (WCRP)   focusing   on   advancing   our   understanding   of   variability    of   the   earth’s   stratosphere   and   its   implications   for   climate   and   weather   prediction.   To   address   these    scientific   questions,   research   activities   are   developed   such   as   the   Data   Assimilation   Working   Group    (DAWG).   The   group   establishes   a   forum   for   modelers,   data   providers,   assimilators   and   users   around    the   SPARC   scientific   community.   The   DAWG   is   recommending   NASA   to   accept   a   limb   sounder    proposal   to   provide   vertical   profiles   of   atmospheric   composition   and   temperature   at   high   vertical    resolution   covering   the   middle   atmosphere   down   into   the   upper   troposphere   during   day   and   night.     Prolonged   limb   observations   have   been   made   by   the   Upper   Atmosphere   Research   Satellites   (UARS),    launched   in   1991,   then   followed   by   several   limb   sounders   launched   in   the   early   2000s.   Today,   some    of   these   instruments   are   no   longer   operating,   the   others   are   aging   and   neither   NASA   nor   ESA   or    other   space   agencies   have   plans   to   replace   them.   So   far,   the   single   planned   operational   mission   that    will   provide   limb   profiling   in   the   next   decade   is   JPSS-­‐2   with   the   Ozone   Mapping   Profiler   Suite   Limb    Profiler   (OMPS-­‐LP)   onboard   and   to   be   launched   in   2022.   The   single   planned   research   mission   is   the    SAGE-­‐III   instrument   that   will   be   put   on   the   International   Space   Station   (ISS)   in   2016.   The   OMPS   limb    sounder   will   provide   day-­‐time   ozone   profiles   and   aerosol   extinction   but   will   neither   measure    temperature   nor   does   it   provide   observations   of   other   important   constituents.   SAGE-­‐III   on   ISS   will    provide   accurate   solar   occultation   profiling   of   O3,   NO2,   H2O,   NO3,   OClO,   aerosol   extinction   and   high-­‐ altitude   cloud   extinction,   albeit   with   very   limited   spatial   coverage.     The   data   assimilation   (DA)   community   relies   on   high   vertical   resolution   profiles   with   good   spatial    coverage   on   a   daily   basis,   including   (polar)   nighttime   observations,   to   monitor   the   onset   of   the    stratospheric   ozone   hole,   to   assess   the   chemical   ozone   loss,   and   to   track   the   ozone   recovery.   For    numerical   weather   prediction,   high   vertical   resolution   temperature   profiling   above   5   hPa   (40   km)   is    critical   to   anchor   satellite   radiance   measurements   made   from   the   meteorological   nadir   instruments    and   to   monitor   and   improve   the   modeled   stratospheric   dynamics,   which   have   an   impact   on    numerical   weather   prediction   and   extended-­‐range   forecasting.   Further,   limb   sounding   observations       are   needed   to   improve   tropospheric   air   quality   monitoring   by   combining   nadir   (total   column)    observations   with   limb   profiles   in   DA   systems.        The   need   for   stratospheric   limb   sounders   has   been   reviewed   by   the   OPEROZ   project   (van   Weele   et    al.,   2015).   It   reports   that   the   present-­‐day   ozone   profile   observations   are   essential   for   climate    reanalyses,   short-­‐term   monitoring   services   which   assimilate   and   forecast   ozone   in   the   troposphere    and   the   stratosphere,   and   for   numerical   weather   prediction.   A   series   of   nadir   sounders   is   planned   in    order   to   continue   the   monitoring   of   total   ozone   and   other   trace   gases.   However,   a   similar   continuous    line   of   future   limb   missions   is   not   planned,   with   the   exception   of   the   above-­‐mentioned   OMPS-­‐LP    instrument   on   JPSS-­‐2.   The   situation   in   the   next   decade   will   be   in   stark   contrast   with   the   suite   of    dedicated   limb   sounders   flown   during   the   last   two   decades.   In   contrast   to   limb   observations,   nadir    profile   observations   strongly   smooth   out   vertical   structure   and   cannot   sufficiently   resolve   the   highly    stratified   middle   atmosphere   and   upper   troposphere.   For   essential   climate   variables   (ECVs)   such   as    O3,   H2O,   CH4,   aerosols,   and   the   ozone   and   aerosol   precursors,   NO2   and   SO2,   nadir   observations    cannot   provide   stratospheric   profiles   with   sufficient   vertical   resolution.   This   seriously   limits   their    value   for   ECV   climate   reanalyses   and   the   attribution   of   ozone   changes   to   either   chemical   or   transport    processes   at   different   altitudes.   OPEROZ   also   reports   the   benefit   of   combining   assimilation   of   limb    and   nadir   types   of   ozone   observations.   The   limb-­‐nadir   combination   provides   a   much   more   accurate    3-­‐D   analysis   of   ozone   in   the   troposphere   and   lower   stratosphere   which   will   improve   upon   ozone    forecasts   for   air   quality.   Assimilation   of   limb-­‐nadir   data   will   also   improve   the   representation   of   the    upper   troposphere   and   lower   stratosphere   region   in   reanalyses.   Climate   is   particularly   sensitive   to    atmospheric   composition   in   this   region   because   this   is   where   much   infrared   radiation   escapes   to    space   and   where   ozone   is   most   effective   as   a   greenhouse   gas.     OPEROZ   has   defined   a   minimum   mission   for   ozone   monitoring   and   a   number   of   potential   mission    extensions.   The   minimum   mission   scenario   requires   a   limb   sounder   providing   ozone   profiles   with    daily   global   coverage   (poles,   mid-­‐latitudes,   tropics)   and   with   day-­‐   and   night-­‐time   measurement    capabilities.   In   the   lower   stratosphere,   the   required   resolution   is   1-­‐2   km   vertically   and   100-­‐200   km    horizontally.   In   the   upper   stratosphere,   the   required   resolution   is   2-­‐4   km   vertically   and   200-­‐400   km    horizontally.   For   deducing   long-­‐term   ozone   profile   trends,   a   series   of   operational   satellites   with   well    (inter-­‐)calibrated   instrumentation   is   necessary.     Two   mission   extensions   defined   by   OPEROZ   would   help   to   understand   why   the   ozone   is   changing   in    the   changing   climate.   Depending   on   the   adopted   technology,   delivered   limb   profiles   would   be   more    suited   to   focus   on   the   dynamical   (Brewer-­‐Dobson   circulation)   or   chemical   drivers   of   stratospheric    ozone   change.   Table   1   lists   the   types   of   observations   required   to   address   these   two   mission    objectives   and   a   first   assessment   of   the   ability   of   three   types   of   observation   techniques:   shortwave    (ultraviolet)   scattering,   infrared   emission   and   microwave   emission.     Although   none   of   the   three   limb   observational   techniques   could   offer   all   of   the   user   requirements   on    their   own,   each   of   them   has   a   strong   heritage   and   also   specific   merits.   Also,   in   addition   to   the    observations   listed   in   the   above   table,   the   added   value   of   ClO   for   polar   ozone   monitoring   and   NO2    profiling   for   air   quality   applications   should   be   noted.   In   conclusion,   the   SPARC   DAWG   recommends    NASA   to   accept   a   limb   sounder   mission   proposal   based   on   at   least   one   of   the   three   techniques    mentioned   above,   in   line   with   the   OPEROZ   data   requirements   on   spatial   coverage,   and   horizontal    and   vertical   resolution.       Table   1   :   Summary   of   the   ability   of   the   various   instrument   types   to   meet   OPEROZ   requirements.   Color   code:    Grey

   Below,   we   reply   to   the   specific   questions   of   the   survey:     1.   What   are   the   key   challenges   or   questions   for   Earth   System   Science   across   the   spectrum   of   basic    research,   applied   research,   applications,   and/or   operations   in   the   coming   decade?     •   Monitoring   stratospheric   changes   is   a   key   issue   in   the   coming   decade.   This   includes    measuring   ozone,   temperature   and   other   trace   gases   related   to   the   dynamics   and   chemistry    of   the   stratosphere.   Providing   initial   and   boundary   conditions   for   air   quality   forecasts   will    also   be   challenging.   To   tackle   these   challenges,   the   DAWG   is   requesting   stratospheric   limb    profiles   of   ozone,   temperature   and   other   relevant   stratospheric   trace   gases   at   high   vertical    resolution.        2.   Why   are   these   challenge/questions   timely   to   address   now   especially   with   respect   to   readiness?     •   Because   space   agencies   have   not   planned   future   stratospheric   limb   sounders   dedicated   to    stratospheric   change   in   a   changing   climate   and   currently   operating   instruments   are   aging.     3.   Why   are   space-­‐based   observations   fundamental   to   addressing   these   challenges/questions?     •   Because   space-­‐based   limb   observations   provide   high   resolution   vertical   profiles   of    constituents   and   temperature   with   daily   global   coverage,   which   is   not   achievable   by   other    measurement   techniques.     a.   Whether   existing   and   planned   U.S.   and   international   programs   will   provide   the   capabilities    necessary   to   make   substantial   progress   on   the   identified   challenge   and   associated   questions.   If   not,    what   additional   investments   are   needed?     •   OMPS   Limb   Profiler   (LP)   onboard   S-­‐NPP   is   currently   operating   but   it   only   measures   daytime    ozone   profile   and   aerosol   extinction   (no   temperature   or   other   species,   and   no    measurements   in   darkness)     •   OMPS-­‐LP   is   planned   on   JPSS-­‐2   (2022)   and   SAGE-­‐III   is   planned   on   ISS   (2016),   with   the    limitations   mentioned   above.     b.   How   to   link   space-­‐based   observations   with   other   observations   to   increase   the   value   of   data   for    addressing   key   scientific   questions   and   societal   needs;     •   The   DA   methodology   effectively   combines   satellite   and   conventional   measurements   with    model   simulations   in   an   integrated   statistical   framework.   For   example,   the   monitoring   of   the    ozone   hole   is   based   on   ground-­‐based,   balloon   borne   and   DA-­‐based   analysis   of   temperature    and   constituents.

Eric Rignot1,2, Ian Joughin3, Mark Fahnestock4    1 University of California Irvine CA  2 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena CA  3 University of Washington, Seattle WA  4 University of Alaska, Fairbanks AK       Sea level rise is a problem of considerable societal and scientific  importance. Projections of sea level rise by year 2100, however, are  affected by considerable uncertainty (Fig. 1), with values ranging  from 20 cm to as much as 2 m, and sea level rising faster after 2100.  A rise of 2 m would displace about 200 million people globally  (Willis and Church, 2012).    Physical models of the Earth used by the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change Report (IPCC AR5) project a global sea level rise  of 20 to 60 cm by 2100, but these projections do not include  contributions from accelerated flow and/or rapid fracture of ice sheets  into the ocean (e.g., Pollard et al., 2014) or catastrophic break up of  ice shelves (MacAyeal et al., 2003)    Upper bounds on sea level from ice sheets have been estimated from kinematic constraints on glacier  flow (Pfeffer et al., 2008) and paleoclimate analogs (Dutton et al., 2015). Paleoclimate records indicate  that during the Eemian period (130,000 to 115,000 years ago), mean temperatures were similar to present  (1-2oC warmer than pre-industrial temperatures), global sea level was 6 to 9 m higher, and parts of  Greenland and West Antarctica Ice Sheets had melted away (Dutton et al., 2015). The rate of sea level  change during the Eemian is not well constrained.    Several marine-based sectors of the Greenland Ice Sheet  totaling 1.1 m sea level equivalent are retreating rapidly (Mouginot  et al., 2015) at present and the Amundsen Sea sector of West  Antarctica is in a state of irreversible retreat with a potential global  sea level rise equivalent of 1.2 m (Joughin et al., 2014; Rignot et al.  2014). In East Antarctica, the marine-based Wilkes Land sector  holds a multi-meter sea level equivalent, with several of its glaciers  thinning, but projections are limited by a lack of ocean  observations.   As marine-based glaciers start retreating inland, the dominant  process of ablation will be ice calving off big walls, but this process  is not well understood at present (e.g., Pollard et al., 2014).    While historical missions considerably advanced our  knowledge of ice dynamics and their role in ice sheet mass balance,  no prior space missions were designed to make ice-sheet dynamics  the prime focus. NISAR will be the first mission of its kind to offer  this capability but its nominal duration is 3 years. Beyond NISAR,  we need to continue measurements with greater observation  frequency to observe rapid changes such as seasonal speed up and  slow down, large iceberg calving events, rapid calving from  embayed, retreating ice cliffs, and accelerating ice discharge.  Understanding of these processes, along with ice-ocean interaction,  is critical to improve the reliability of sea level projections from  melting land ice.   Figure 1: Landsat-8 image of the calving front of  Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, which has rapidly  retreated since 2002 and is now calving 18 km  inland into a 2-km deep canyon, with a 0.5-m  global sea level rise potential. Tracking fracturing  mechanisms is important to reduce uncertainties  of projections of ice sheet evolution.    0     0.2     0.4     0.6     0.8     1     1.2     1.4     1.6     1.8     2     1990    2000    2010    2020    2030    2040    2050    2060    2070    2080    2090    2100     Figure 2.

Basic Research:   1) Quantifying changes in ice flow regime of ice sheets at high-enough temporal and spatial  resolutions to reduce uncertainties in sea level rise reconstruction.    2) Quantifying ice fluxes into the ocean to reconstruct sea level fingerprints.   3) Quantifying the feedback between ice-ocean interaction and ice dynamics.   4) Providing adequate observational constraints for ice sheet numerical models to capture rapidly   evolving component of ice sheets: seasonal acceleration and slow down, iceberg calving,  grounding line migration.   5) Improved understanding of glacier calving dynamics.   Applied research:   1) Building up big-data assimilation techniques for ice sheet numerical models to incorporate  information about ice dynamics (and also surface mass balance).      3          Operations:   1) Providing space-based platforms capable of measuring ice flow dynamics accurately, uniformly  and frequently over ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps (Table 1), including in 3 dimensions, which  requires the ability to routinely image to the left and right of the orbit track (which is also  required for pole-to-pole coverage).       2) Timeliness and Readiness  Many major glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica have opened up their respective floodgates and   started a possibly irreversible retreat inland, with decades to centuries of future sea level rise. Despite  their global significance, the mechanics of glacier flow, ice fracture into icebergs, and ice-ocean  interaction (including ice shelf melt into the ocean) are the least-well understood components of sea level  rise for decades to centuries to come.      3) Fundamental aspects of space-based observations in addressing key surface process questions     The technologies for the requested sensors exist. Monitoring ice dynamics from space requires  multiple sensors, including time series of InSAR data, ICESAT-2, and Landsat follow-on. CubeSat  constellation and suborbital assets (Operation IceBridge) would increase the temporal resolution for key  measurements.  These resources would have additional applications for sea ice monitoring, solid earth  science and ecology (aka NISAR).    Space-based observations (Table 1) can address key scientific questions and societal needs by  providing the spatio-temporal resolution required to characterize ice dynamics across glaciers and ice  sheets worldwide.      Table 1 provides a list of measurements needed to overcome existing limitations and  subsequently contribute to improve sea level projections.  Table 1 provides a general assessment of  readiness for space-based applications.     4) Scientific Community Involvement   There is broad support in the scientific community for comprehensive space-based measurements  of ice flow dynamics.  We expect additional white papers highlighting the need for improved  understanding of ice dynamics.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?      Earth System Science (ESS) embodies a holistic approach to understanding the geophysical,   biophysical, and biogeochemical processes, interactions, and exchanges that sustain all life-  support systems on Earth.  In the last few decades, the attempts to deconstruct and   understand the changing states of Earth’s life-support systems have led to a realization that   studying natural and anthropogenic processes in isolation is not conducive to revealing the   complex nature of interactions and feedbacks that are better exemplified as emergent   properties through their coupled systems behavior.  This realization not only justifies an   ESS approach, but also propels a key challenge to sustain ESS as a data-intensive   knowledge domain.  Consequently, we should distinguish between approaches that address   the need to focus on improving and understanding the domain science knowledge versus   those that address smarter ways of handling the data that contribute to that domain   knowledge.  This paper’s thesis advocates the latter as a viable approach to articulate and   better understand ESS epistemology, and develop intelligent ways to handle the data and   information to delineate complex environmental change dynamics.      ESS is both data- and computing-intensive.  Therefore, conducting either basic or applied   research and applications entail the acquisition, compilation, processing, and analysis of   data from varied knowledge domains.  Besides multidisciplinary inputs this may require   deep knowledge integration through transdisciplinary sources (socio-economic,   demographic, etc.) as well.  Hence, this involves data sources with disparate methodologies,   ambiguous terminologies, and a motley mix of data and metadata formats and standards   that could potentially create bottlenecks for data handling, representation, discovery,   integration and interoperability.  Further compounding this are increasingly massive   volumes of data that vary across types, qualities, and pedigrees, which necessitates smart   data management solutions.      Technology offers an approach to meet the challenge of dealing with this burgeoning data-   and computing-intensive science.  Since the current incarnation of the World-Wide Web      2   was created in 1989, the same technologies are continuing to help create machine-encoded   semantics that can potentially transform how humans and machines interact with what is   called Linked Data, a method to create and publish structured data based on current Web   standards, and a set of best practices.  Linked Data are semantically enabled and machine-  readable, and hence, shareable, queryable, and reusable across applications, and offer an   efficient conceptual model for intelligently handling and managing ESS data.  The term   Linked Data is an integral of the original concept of Semantic Web, which itself has   transformed from its original design.  It can facilitate ESS by providing a formal mechanism   to define, represent, and integrate its concepts and relationships based on contextual   semantics to discover patterns, relationships, and predictive analytics as well.  This   technology has the potential to leverage a paradigm shift, but a major challenge for ESS is   consensus acceptance.  When compared to early adopters like the medical and   bioinformatics1 communities, the Earth science community has yet to invest in these   technologies in a significant fashion.        Data-intensive science poses a serious set of challenges to data management and   stewardship for ESS in the next decade; we have already experienced symptoms of these   thus far.  They relate to strengthening attribution, reproducibility, and provenance for ESS   research and applications.  All three areas will help alleviate skepticism from those who do   not understand, misunderstand, or consciously obfuscate the science of global   environmental change by stymying the progress to accomplish objective policy-based   science2.  Linked Data facilitates addressing all three challenges.      The final challenge is more sociological.  The epistemic culture3 of different knowledge   domains determines how successfully they encourage (or discourage) their practitioners to   use new methods and approaches.  The epistemic culture within ESS is a valuable source of   information that is worthy of investigation to help reveal how idiosyncrasies of team                                                    1 Good examples in biomedical informatics and translational medicine include the following, respectively:  Shortliffe, E., and Cimino, J.

Related to epistemic culture   are recent developments in the Science of Team Science4 that explore the attributes deemed   necessary to achieve a collaborative team’s scientific and translational goals, and also   highlight the existing sociology of scientific knowledge.      2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?     The urgency of the Anthropocene is increasingly being manifested via humans and their   activities that have become a new global forcing agent,5 and a global geological force in its own   right.6  The increasing impact of human dominance is borne by Earth’s different biophysical   thresholds.  According to some researchers7 humans have already transgressed three of the   nine planetary boundaries with very serious consequences for all life globally in the near   future.  Science and society in the next few decades must contend with how best to   understand and interpret the dynamics of global environmental change, and help inform   policymakers by carefully addressing different scales of governance vis-à-vis scales of   analyses.  Linked Data offers an informatics-based approach with an unprecedented   capability in linking datasets representing natural and human processes to support an   evolving knowledge ecosystem.      An array of national and international studies/programs8 continue to deliberate on various   aspects of global environmental change even as policy and governance aspects to   understand, manage, and mitigate its impacts are often mired in ideological and geopolitical   squabbles.  Most studies concur with the seriousness of what is happening but do not                                                    4 National Research Council. (2015).

More data are constantly being acquired and processed than the ability to analyze and distill   knowledge from them in a timely fashion.  Besides, the coupled use of data from multiple   sources in conjunction with model simulations is only likely to increase in our quest to   understand global Earth processes at various spatial and temporal scales.  Therefore,   investing in contemporary data handling technologies is imperative.  As a complement to   Linked Data, smart solutions also exist to build an efficient cyberinfrastructure as   collaborative computational environments that provide hardware and software platforms,   tools, services, networks, protocols, data systems, and people interacting within a distributed   architecture.  But ESS has yet to fully benefit from all these technologies.      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?      Remote sensing-based observations remain absolutely central to our ability to conduct ESS   research and applications essentially because they provide panoptic views and time-series   measurements of all elements of Earth’s life-support systems that are impossible to replicate   using ground-based methods.  Alongside our space-based observation capabilities, we also   need to invest in infrastructure that enables the machine-readability of the derived datasets   to create ESS Linked Data to support derived knowledge management functions.      Given the budgetary constraints to fund future Earth observing missions, NASA should   consider not only building partnerships with the commercial sector but also with friendly   global allies who have reliable and established civilian space programs.  The nature of the   global environmental challenges in the near future may, of necessity, warrant such   partnerships.    ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":""}

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research,  applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?     One of the key challenges for Earth System Science is to develop and implement space-based  observing systems that will confront the climate modeling community in such a way that will  result in reduced uncertainty both in climate change projections and vexing metrics such as  climate sensitivity and societally-relevant temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation trends  and extremes.    Given the complexity, time, and cost associated with the development of new satellite  observations, it is incumbent upon the Earth System Science community to estimate the scientific  and societal value of new observations prior to their development or launch, and use this as a  basis for prioritizing the implementation of novel observations.    The use of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), whereby model outputs are used  as a basis to emulate the signals that would be observed by a novel instrument, can provide a  path towards estimating that value. OSSEs can also allow those with expertise in the  development of new observations and those with expertise in model development to converge in  order to design observing systems in such a way as to interrogate models and test hypotheses  regarding key sources of uncertainty in model design or implementation. Although it is not  developed as an OSSE experiment, the widespread adoption of inline instrument emulation     through the CFMIP Observational Simulator Package (COSP) and recent use of Obs4MIPS  satellite data, indicate that the climate model community is highly motivated to confront climate  model output with a suite of existing measurements. A similar level of participation in the  mission-planning process is warranted.    As a tool for satellite instrument development, OSSEs techniques have significant heritage in the  numerical weather prediction (NWP) community, whereby a key metric for proposed new  observations is the OSSE-generated improvement in forecasting skill derived from the addition  of the proposed measurement system and assimilation of its data.     Still, it must be recognized that the OSSEs are an insufficient substitute for actual observations,  because systematic errors in the model data and overly optimistic instrument error estimations,  both of which serve as inputs to the OSSE, could bias simulations. Furthermore, it is difficult to  estimate how errors in the actual data will propagate into novel instrument science and societal  value. Therefore, results of analysis performed with OSSEs should be considered as a best-case  scenario, rather than a best estimate, for answering the specific question posed by the OSSE.     For NWP, the existence of an established forecast model and the incremental increase in skill  from new observations has mitigated the abovementioned risks associated with OSSE technique.  The challenges for OSSE development for non-incremental, more transformative measurements  are more serious, but should be considered in a hypothesis-testing framework, rather than NWP  operational forecast perspective of OSSEs. That is, where model representations and  parameterizations disagree, OSSEs may be able to illuminate those measurements that would  lead to constraints. For   climate   change   and   climate   change   process   observations,   the   mismatch   of   time-­‐scales   between   the   nominal   observing   system   lifetimes   and   the   time-­‐scales   of   secular   trends   and   natural   variability,   OSSEs   are   even   more   central   to   assessing   the   science   value   of   a   proposed   mission.   Reinforcing   this   point,   the   NRC   report   `Continuity   of   NASA   Earth   Observations   from   Space:   A   Value   Framework`   (2015)   has   recommended   that   NASA   increase   its   OSSE   capability   in   order   to   more   quantitatively   evaluate   the   `Utility`   of   future   observations   to   addressing   Quantitative   Earth   Science   Objectives   or   `QESOs`.      The   examples   given   in   that   report   specifically   apply   to   climate   change   QESOs.      For space-based observations, there is a pressing need for NASA to utilize OSSEs, but the OSSE  capability must be developed judiciously and be free from conflicts of interest. The development  of OSSE capability is relatively straightforward, though non-trivial in scope, requiring expertise  in remote sensing technology, orbital mechanics, instrument emulation, the underlying model  inputs, and advanced computer resources and architectures, all of which are necessary for an  OSSE. However, given the competitive scientific and financial landscape for new satellite  instrument missions, it is important for the Earth System Science community to consider the  implementation of OSSEs by research teams that are independent from the teams and/or NASA  centers that are implementing the missions. This is necessary because myriad assumptions are  inherent in the development of the OSSE, and if OSSEs are to be used as a tool to evaluate  mission science and societal value, the community must accept the impartiality of the OSSE  results. OSSE results derived from (preferably multiple) independent investigations, as opposed  to those arising from within a science team, will be free of real and perceived conflicts of  interest. Policies to establish conflict-of-interest-free OSSE capability should be developed and     should consider expertise both inside and outside NASA centers. Furthermore, by entraining the  expertise of major modeling groups from the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science  Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, along with Universities, there will be more community-wide interest in the novel  observations simulated by the OSSE efforts. This should dovetail the effort to develop an  independent capability for NWP OSSEs for NASA through the GMAO program.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?     It is timely to formalize the methods by which the science and societal value are assessed for  novel satellite-based observations, because this will create a more rigorous process to tie  modeling uncertainties to observation priorities. This will help span the persistent gulf between  model and observation development by entraining the modeling community to establish a set of  observational priorities, rather than developing tools only to utilize the data that currently exist.  The current, informal nature for determining science and societal value may lead to mission  decisions based on qualitative assessment. The observations to date, while vastly improving the  scientific community’s understanding of Earth system processes, have evidently not led to  reduced uncertainty in the models even in fundamental metrics of climate change, such as  climate sensitivity, and trends in temperature, humidity, winds and precipitation means and  extremes. Only coordinated, hypothesis-driven research, which can be assisted with OSSEs, will  bring the relevant communities together to plan for future observational systems that can  systematically reduce errors in model projections for our changing planet.      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?     The comprehensive nature of space-based observations enables both large- and small-scale  comparisons with model outputs. For this reason, they are particularly relevant to model  confrontation. However, a comprehensive, independent OSSE capability within or exterior to  NASA currently does not exist and will require additional planning and investment. Specifically,  planning should focus on viable strategies to advance OSSE capability as a service to NASA  mission evaluation while mitigating conflicts of interest, through the promotion and incentivizing  of impartiality. Consequently, investment should consider strategies to promote OSSE expertise  across multiple NASA centers and with model development stakeholders. This could take the  form of a super-center OSSE capability and/or the promotion of OSSE capability at major  modeling centers with scientific and programmatic priorities that are quite independent of NASA  mission development.         ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"william collins::bruce wielicki::jonathan jiang::isaac moradi::nikki prive::"}

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, and/or operations in the coming decades?  NASA, NOAA, the USGS and the government of the United States face a daunting task with  respect to deciding appropriate investments to make in the study of the Earth, its atmosphere, and  its climate. At no time in our history have weather and climate played such a large role in  everyday life, in our economy, and in national security. The examples of Hurricane Katrina in  2005 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 show how just one event can lead to billions of dollars in  damages and disruption of local communities and economies for years afterwards. These events  are arguably minor in comparison with the anticipated disruptions on a global scale from climate  change. An example of implications of climate change for national security can be found at:    http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12914/national-security-implications-of-climate-change-for-us- naval-forces    The 2017 Decadal Survey (DS) must therefore confront and address the specific observational  needs and challenges associated with advancing knowledge of climate change. This will require  outlining an integrated and complimentary set of rigorously quantified, definitive measurements  that will continue for decades. Such measurements are, by necessity, distinct from those that may  only need to occur for a single mission to study the processes that influence weather and climate  and the Earth system.    Adding to the challenge of developing a viable Survey is the anticipated economic and funding  environment of the next decade and beyond. International economies (the United States, Japan,  the United Kingdom, China, and the European Union) are still responding to the financial crisis  of 2007-2009 with unprecedented economic stimulus measures. These countries are also dealing  with continued growth of sovereign debt and ageing populations. These economic conditions  have resulted in constraints on discretionary spending from which scientific endeavors such as  space flight projects are funded. To be viable the 2017 Earth Science Decadal Survey must        2     confront this economic reality by assessing which missions offer the potential for the most  significant economic impact in the near and long terms, rather than solely from the perspective of  how many missions can fly for the anticipated funding.     We therefore propose that this new Decadal Survey seriously consider the distinct needs of  climate change missions by not viewing them as simply missions in a long queue that also  includes process study missions. The continuing lack of quantitative assessment of climate  change and appropriate societal response, increases daily the risk of continued accumulated  economic consequences. The only way to assuage this is to begin a climate record of known high  accuracy that will be continued well into the future, until, as described below, the advantage of  high accuracy is realized through earlier detection of climate change.     We therefore advocate that as part of its deliberations, the new DS establish a Panel to study and  recommend a strategy for initiating measurements of climate change from space in concert with  other Panels recommending the more traditional process oriented missions.     2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with request to  readiness?     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?     Measurement of climate change inherently involves the reliable determination of trends of  atmospheric parameters such as temperature, moisture, cloud properties and extent, trace species,  etc., over multi-decadal timescales. This challenge involves assessing measurements that  necessarily will be made by different instruments built by different engineers and analyzed by  different generations of scientists. The necessary link to enable quantitative information on  climate change to be drawn from these long-term datasets is very high absolute calibration,  measured on-orbit for the life of each mission, to known (Systeme International, SI) standards.  Process study missions typically do not require stringent absolute calibration nor do they  typically need to be conducted over decades. Thus there is a real difference in approach and  requirements to measuring climate change and to conducting traditional process study missions  that NASA in particular has undertaken. Measurements from space are essential to quantify the  extent of global climate change.     To achieve accurate measurement of climate change, the scientific community embarked over a  decade ago to define the approach to achieving high accuracy, SI traceable measurements on- orbit. Two community workshops, the first held in 2002 and titled “Satellite Instrument  Calibration for Measuring Global Climate Change,” and the second held in 2006 and titled  “Achieving Satellite Instrument Calibration for Climate Change” outlined these approaches. The  community reports are available online at:    http://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/pub/upload/nistir7047.pdf    http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/documents/ASIC3-071218-webversfinal.pdf          3     These approaches were the basis of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory  (CLARREO) mission recommended as a Tier 1 mission in the 2007 Decadal Survey. These  principles have been rigorously matured into concrete measurement objectives (e.g., absolute  accuracy, time and space sampling, etc.) in the interim, as described in detail by Wielicki et al.  [2013]. The CLARREO mission principles of high accuracy, tied on-orbit to SI standards, so that  they may be trusted for decades to come, exemplify the needed climate change measurement.  The CLARREO mission, however, remains in pre-formulation as of this writing.     The major question in response to climate change is, how much to mitigate and when? To  answer this question the need is urgent to embark on dedicated climate change measurements  from space. As noted in the Introduction to this White Paper, climate change carries enormous  economic impact. Burke et al. [2015] noted that “unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the  global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global  income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change.”     Only with accurate climate measurements from space will policy makers assuredly know how  and when to mitigate and the economic advantage of doing so. As shown by Cooke et al. [2014],  highly accurate climate change measurements allow the determination of climate trends sooner  than existing measurement systems, moving forward in time by decades our knowledge of  climate change and climate sensitivity. This knowledge allows for society to make decisions  earlier and with higher confidence, thus averting future damages from climate change. These  averted damages can amount to trillions of (US) dollars. Cooke et al., [2015] have shown that the  economic savings from accurate climate measurements are still in the trillions of dollars even  when mitigation costs are considered. The enormous economic benefit of early detection  afforded by highly accurate measurements is due to the non-linear effects of climate change,  particularly temperature, on the global economy. In essence, these accurate measurements serve  as early warning sentinels for the climate system, thus enabling tangible economic benefits.     A similar focus on quantitative climate change goals, high accuracy observations, and using  accuracy to minimize the delay in societal climate change information is contained in the recent  NRC report `Continuity of NASA Earth Observations from Space: A Value Framework` (2015).   The need for accuracy as the foundation of long-term climate observations is also called for in  the 2012 WMO-CEOS report `   Strategy Towards an Architecture for Climate Monitoring from  Space` (2012). These reports may be found online at:    http://www.nap.edu/catalog/21789/continuity-of-nasa-earth-observations-from-space-a-value- framework     http://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/climate/current-activities/    NASA and other domestic and international Agencies must begin true climate change missions.  These missions do not fit existing paradigms of missions undertaken for scientific curiosity or  process studies, or for operational or continuity missions such as weather forecasting. The high  accuracy required and the commitment to decadal measurements are not consistent with current  NASA flight mission solicitations such as the successful Earth Venture (EV) program initiated at  the recommendation of the 2007 Decadal Survey. Specifically, EV mission budgets typically        4     admit no more than 2 years of on-orbit data and thus EV mission length and cost constraints  preclude even the initiation of an accurate climate change record.     4. Summary   We believe it is incumbent on the new Decadal Survey to convene a Panel specifically devoted  to investigating and recommending a strategy of climate change measurements from space for  NASA and other Agencies to initiate at the earliest possible time. This Panel should be tasked  with recommending how these missions will be initiated, budgeted, and ultimately maintained  throughout many decades to come. Data stewardship will be a key issue as well. In order to  recommend those missions technically ready to initiate now, the Panel would also work closely  with technology readiness Panel(s) normally convened under the new DS.     In summary, we believe that starting an accurate climate change record is of the highest national  priority – every day that passes tacitly accumulates more economic damages from climate  change due to lack of concrete knowledge on specific actions to take. In delay, there is also the  risk in over-regulating and under-regulating because of the absence of concrete knowledge,  which is precisely what is now limiting international progress on agreements to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. We therefore strongly advocate that the 2017 Decadal Survey  convene a Panel to address the issue of accurate climate change measurements from space and to  ultimately recommend a sound strategy for their prompt initiation. No other measurements have  the potential to profoundly impact the future of humanity, both scientifically and economically.     References:   Note: The Cooke et al.

Mannucci, Clara Chew, Joe Turk   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology  November 2, 2015     • Global   energy   balance   provides   an   excellent   framework   for   Earth   science    • Rigorous   understanding   of   limitations   in   global   datasets   is   required    • A   broad   remote   sensing   portfolio   using   a   wide   variety   of   emission   sources   and   mission   scenarios   is   enabling           Key   Challenges:      Understanding the Earth’s global energy balance, and whether human activities are causing  large-scale changes, is a major scientific challenge. This challenge is important to address for  intellectual and practical reasons. A gradual warming of the atmosphere, which is hypothesized  to occur as a result of human-induced increasing green house gas (GHG) concentrations, may  lead to significant impacts on human life, possibly affecting food and water security, natural  disasters, weather extremes, and habitability of coastal areas. Warming is fundamentally due to  an imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy that manifests itself globally at the top of  the atmosphere. Increasing GHG concentrations leads to warming because the bulk emissivity of  Earth is changed so that less energy is radiated, and temperatures must rise until a new  equilibrium between incoming and outgoing energy is established at higher temperatures. The  character of our environment under this new equilibrium is of major interest and concern.     While the factors affecting Earth’s equilibrium temperature can and should be understood at  ever-finer levels of detail, we must find alternative approaches that do not require the energy  balance to be determined from detailed understanding of every contributing process. Fortunately,  a series of papers, e.g. by Trenberth et al. (2009, doi:10.1175/2008BAMS2634.1) and Stephens  et al., (2012, doi:10.1038/NGEO1580), demonstrate that an advanced understanding of energy  balance is already achieved. These papers categorize and quantify the physical processes leading  to imbalance, including: incoming and reflected short-wave radiation, atmospheric absorption,  surface versus atmospheric reflection and absorption, sensible and latent heating of the  atmosphere, and the role of clouds. Each of these categories can be further broken down to finer  levels of detail that will occupy scientific investigations for many years to come.    As clearly shown by Stephens et al., (2012), uncertainties can be assigned to these major  categories of energy flow. These authors find that the uncertainty of the imbalance as a whole is  comparable to the imbalance itself. Thus, the current understanding of the imbalance is  inadequate, and projection of future imbalances needs improvement. The uncertainties of  individual contributors to the energy budget also exceed the uncertainty of the overall imbalance.  Much more needs to be learned, and space-based observations will play a critical role in this  research. In future Earth science research, a balance must be achieved between detailed process  knowledge and quantifying the broad categories of energy transfer.     The global energy balance perspective involves a broad range of science areas from atmospheric  dynamics, to the carbon and water cycles, to solid Earth (volcanic aerosols). Advances in all       Decadal Survey RFI:            Measuring, Monitoring and Understanding Earth’s Energy Balance          2   these areas will lead to reduced uncertainty in the contributors to the energy imbalance.  Reducing these uncertainties by observational means will vastly improve our understanding of  energy balance. Eventually, based on such observations, models may be constructed that could  be more helpful in forecasting future climate.     On the other hand, if an observational focus on the global energy balance is not adopted,  progress in understanding climate change may be long in coming. Requiring a detailed  understanding of small-scale to meso-scale processes sufficient to constrain contributions to the  imbalance is an excellent long-term goal. However, only emphasizing such detailed process  knowledge will, in the near term, lead to increased uncertainties associated with individual  contributors to the imbalance. The many contributing processes exhibit large variabilities with  season, diurnal cycle, geographic location and geophysical condition. Intellectually,  understanding this variability is an important goal, but practically, these variabilities are going to  tax our intellectual capital to address them all.     The solution is to constrain the major contributors to Earth’s energy imbalance using  observations wherever possible. This can be done with the right combination of observational  systems that gather and process radiant energy and measure thermodynamic quantities in the  oceans, land and atmosphere. Our understanding is sufficient to identify the major contributors to  balance, but our observational systems so far do not produce adequate constraints.      Timeliness:      The global energy balance as a framework for understanding Earth and climate is of significant  practical value. A paper published in 2013 (“Value of information for climate observing  systems”, Cooke et al., doi:10.1007/s10669-013-9451-8) shows that higher accuracy observing  systems reduce the time required to detect the magnitude of climate change, increasing the  probability of near-term action by moving away from “business-as-usual” scenarios. Therefore a  focus on global energy balance and its change over time, accurately measured, is of high priority.     Why   Space?         It is inconceivable to address the global energy balance without space-based data. For example,  in the paper by Stephens et al. (2012), satellite observations were used either directly or through  gridded reanalysis products. The following satellites contributed data to the paper: CERES  (multi-satellite), NASA A-Train low Earth orbiters Terra and Aqua, Geostationary satellites  (critical for cloud inventories via the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project),  Cloudsat, CALIPSO (aerosol), MODIS (surface fluxes), TRMM (rainfall), microwave sounders  onboard DMSP, NOAA, and MetOp satellites (humidity and precipitation), among others.  Although ground based networks are critical for validation and for ocean and soil data at depth, it  is not possible to understand the global energy balance without global observations from space.         Decadal Survey RFI:           Measuring, Monitoring and Understanding Earth’s Energy Balance        3   Responses to the Questions:     a.   Is   there   a   capability   gap?        Existing and planned programs do not focus on reducing the observational uncertainties in the  global energy balance. These uncertainties can only be reduced with a concerted effort. The  focus on energy balance need not preempt other scientific investigations, but an over-arching  energy theme should influence a wide variety of future Earth science missions.    Even with such a focus, there exists a persistent problem that the Earth science community has  not yet fully addressed: the issue of global sampling from satellite. The enormous benefits of  space-based sampling in some cases leads to complacency and a lack of critical thinking  regarding the products derived from satellites. Once gridded products are developed from  satellite data, with the attendant efforts to validate and make them as accurate as possible, there  is a tendency to ignore fundamental limitations of these products that hinder observing the global  energy balance. Such limitations arise for several reasons that cannot be overcome easily.  Examples are: 1) lack of sampling in cloudy regions by infrared remote sensing techniques; 2)  poor characterization of surface emissivities particularly over land for microwave remote  sensing, 3) insufficient sampling of the full range of precipitation intensity, 4) insufficient  vertical resolution of humidity from all-weather sounders (e.g. microwave) 5) insufficient  accounting for the episodic nature of precipitation and its impact on global inventories, 6)  incomplete geographic coverage, 6) inadequate sampling of the diurnal cycle from slowly  precessing or sun-fixed satellite platforms. Such limitations (among others) will bias the  observational record of the global energy balance.    The community, therefore, must eschew complacency and embrace activism, to aggressively  expand the remote sensing portfolio to include new platforms, new regions of the  electromagnetic spectrum, new signal sources, higher spatial resolution and lower revisit times,  and new approaches to missions that specifically address gaps that are persistent in the current  record. In addition, international coordination should be embraced more aggressively than in the  past. A comprehensive and detailed inventory of observational limitations and gaps should be  undertaken. Fortunately, Earth science has sufficient first-order understanding of many processes  that at least the gaps can be identified.    b.   Linking   space-­‐based   observations   with   other   observations;        Programs are currently in place linking new satellite observations with ground-based  observations that permit detailed understanding of physical processes locally. To improve our  knowledge of global energy balance, such efforts connecting global observation to process  understanding are critical and must continue.     c.   Scientific   and   Societal   Benefits     The study by Cooke et al. (2013, doi:10.1007/s10669-013-9451-8) shows that observational  accuracies can significantly influence policy decisions. Higher-accuracy observing systems  provide the means sooner to achieve the needed confidence to change practices and policies. The  potential savings achieved by confidently deviating from “business as usual” practices is in the       Decadal Survey RFI:            Measuring, Monitoring and Understanding Earth’s Energy Balance          4   trillions of dollars.    d.   The   science   communities   that   would   be   involved.         Given that we need global observations, and the challenges in bias and coverage that such  observations pose, consideration must be given to a wide variety of methods of addressing global  observation. This need not always involve space-based observations (e.g. Argo) but it is  impossible to address these grand challenges without space as a major platform. The science  communities involved in this endeavor encompass the remote sensing and radiative transfer  communities, hydrology/water cycle, vegetation/carbon cycle, ocean scientists, and troposphere  to stratosphere experts.     In this white paper we have specifically emphasized observations but it should not be inferred  that modeling is not of critical importance also, particularly when climate projections are needed.  The reason for our emphasis on observations is that observations undergird the scientific method  and provide the needed rigor. Whereas theory and modeling are critical, they rest on a foundation  of observations that, if incomplete, can only exacerbate our difficulties in understanding global  change.

However, our limited understanding of the coupled  interactions among the sea ice, ocean, atmosphere, and land hinders our ability to predict the  rate and magnitude of future change. The need to understand, adapt to and take advantage of a  changing sea ice cover places new demands on the research community and observational  systems. Societal needs require that we:    • Continue development of focused research and integrated observational networks to  better understand the changing arctic. This includes improved subseasonal-to-seasonal  forecasts and refined projections of future climate patterns and how they will develop  as a result of the interacting physical, biological, and human systems.   • Develop tools for scaling predictions of arctic-wide ice conditions down to the local- to-regional level at which most decision-makers operate. Local information is needed  to understand how decisions will influence the dynamics of the natural and social- ecological systems that they manage.   Key Questions:    • How predictable are different aspects of the Arctic sea ice cover, and what is needed  to improve predictability at the local and regional scale to facilitate planning,  mitigation, and adaptation? Improvements in model physics and specification of initial  state. While there are intrinsic limitations on Arctic sea ice predictability, some appear  to reside in the initial ice/ocean state and in the longer-term trend; the initial states  (e.g. thickness, snow depth, etc.) affect the potential trajectories in the evolution of ice  coverage.    • What are the critical linkages between the Arctic system and the larger Arctic and  global systems? Although efforts are under way to better understand the role of Arctic  sea ice in this broader context, progress has been limited by the lack of coordinated  observations of sea ice and associated forcing parameters (atmosphere and ocean) at  appropriate time and space scales.      Addressing these questions depends on a robust program of well-planned and coordinated  observations. Improving short- and long-term forecasts will require better models, with fully  coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere processes that assimilate advanced observations and generate  time-varying sea-ice concentration, thickness, and ice-edge location at high temporal and  spatial resolution.  Continuous or frequently repeated data collection will be needed, including  broad surveys of ice conditions over the annual cycle to initialize forecasts. Furthermore, data      2   should be returned in near real-time to support forecasting at shorter time scales and to verify  sensor performance.    2 Key Sea Ice Parameters  We advocate the continued and coordinated monitoring of four crucial sea ice parameters in  2017-2027. They are: sea ice concentration, thickness and motion, and snow depth.   Ice concentration. These retrievals are from passive microwave measurements acquired by  the series of space-based radiometers, that started with NASA's Nimbus-7 SMMR in 1979,  has been maintained by successive SSM/Is launched by the Defense Meteorological Satellite  Program (DMSP) and by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA's) GCOM-W  AMSR2. The DMSP program will be ending and JAXA’s plan to launch another space-based  radiometer at this time is in question. Without these assets, the time series for monitoring the  sea ice cover, used in a broad range of applications (from operational to scientific research),  may come to an end - this includes the multi-decadal record of ice extent that has served to  document the dramatic decline in the Arctic Ocean sea ice coverage. This is of significant  concern if there were no commitments to continue these measurements.   Time-variable sea ice thickness, motion and snow depth observations are essential for  describing the evolution of the ice cover. While thermodynamic processes are responsible for  mass changes at the upper and lower surfaces of the ice, it is mechanical processes due to  non-uniform ice motion that cause the formation of the thinnest (leads) and thickest ice  (pressure ridges) in the thickness distribution. On longer time scales, the thickness distribution  represents a time-integral of interactions between the thermodynamic and dynamic responses  of the ice cover to external forcing. There is hence a requirement of coupled observations of  ice thickness and motion for documenting changes, understanding processes, and for use in  predictions and projections as well as validation of ice conditions at various time scales. Snow  on sea ice is important because it regulates the transfer of heat through the pack ice. Further,  meltwater from winter snow, together with surface roughness, determines melt pond coverage  and albedo of the summer ice surface.     Ice thickness distribution. To date, both the ICESat-1 and CryoSat-2 (CS-2) missions have  provided ice thickness estimates from retrieved sea ice freeboard. Although CS-2 has passed  its nominal mission life, ESA plans to continue operations. ICESat-2 will be launched in 2017  for a 3-year mission and measurement of sea ice freeboard as one of its science requirements.  ESA’s Sentinel-3 (launch in late 2015) will carry an altimeter similar to CS-2 but the sun- synchronous orbit inclination will offer coverage of only 70% of the Arctic Ocean.  Furthermore, radar altimeter-based retrievals currently also cannot reliably provide ice  thickness during the summer months. Beyond 2021, there are currently no plans for another  altimeter suitable for fully mapping Arctic sea ice thickness. This is an important  consideration.   Ice motion. Sea-ice motion can be retrieved from time-sequential satellite imagery. The  quality of these measurements depends more on the geometric fidelity and image resolution  than on a thorough physical understanding of the ice signatures. Although motion estimates  have been derived from a variety of sensors, only Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery  provides high enough resolution to capture small-scale ice deformation.   NISAR (launch      3   data: 2020) will provide 3-day ice motion for a large part of the Arctic Ocean. Beyond  NISAR, a follow-on SAR mission or an ESA SAR mission may be needed.    Coordinated observations: motion and thickness. Satellite retrievals of sea ice thickness and  motion are typically acquired independently with little consideration of the close links  between thermodynamic and dynamic processes that control ice conditions, which must be  treated realistically to improve predictive models. While near-simultaneous observations of  these parameters challenge current satellite technologies, the science need is high and merits  special attention.   Snow depth.  Approaches to extract snow depth from passive microwave measurements exist  but there are significant limitations. The capability of measuring snow depth has been  demonstrated with airborne radar on Operation IceBridge but a spaceborne approach has yet  to be demonstrated. NASA’s GPM mission can measure snowfall and thus may enable  estimates of snow depth but its inclination limits coverage to 65oN. Snow depth is arguably  one of the most important polar variables for which no long-term and Arctic-wide  measurement concept has been developed.    3 Other considerations  We discuss other considerations in the design of observational systems that would benefit  other needed observations of the Arctic sea ice.   Coordination/Validation. Given limited resources, coordination of national and international  assets (field programs, airborne campaigns) is important for validation and assessment of  satellite retrievals. The development of sub-orbital platforms (UAVs) is crucial for validation  of on-orbit assets. A sustained network of coordinated in-situ observations will be necessary  to complement space-based observations. In-situ measurements for validation as well as to  provide information on variables not readily observed from space are needed.  In particular,  observations of heat storage and distribution in the upper ocean as well as buoys capable of  measuring individual components of the ice mass balance are critical to complement space  based observations of thickness and deformation.  High inclination orbits and other satellite missions. Where feasible and appropriate, satellite  missions that can support Arctic research should consider higher inclination orbits to provide  better high latitude coverage. A good example of a multiple-use instrument was the  scatterometer on QuikSCAT, which provided maps of multiyear coverage during its mission.  Observations of clouds and precipitation over the Arctic: a critical gap. To understand past  variability and improve forecasts require accurate information about all components of the sea  ice mass and energy balance. While this white paper addresses surface remote sensing, cloud  cover has first-order impacts on the surface energy balance that affect, and are affected by, the  sea ice cover. Critical processes, particularly cloud formation and their connection to sea ice  and aerosols, need to be better characterized to improve our understanding of the surface  energy balance and how cloud conditions will change in a changing Arctic climate. To date,  the temporal and spatial variability of the most basic cloud variables is highly uncertain and  the impact of changing surface characteristics (sea ice, melt ponds) is not well constrained.   Measurements of cloud profiles from CloudSat/Calipso over the Arctic suffer retrieval  problems due to ground interference and attenuation by thicker clouds. Further, precipitation      4   affects surface albedo, ice growth and melt, but satellite measurements of precipitation are  currently not from polar orbits and hence do not provide the necessary coverage.    4 Antarctic sea ice   The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing and this trend and its variability are  poorly understood. Changes in the patterns of sea ice in the Southern Ocean strongly affect  atmospheric and oceanic circulations as well as carbon dioxide uptake, and the Antarctic biota  and ecosystems; therefore, improved monitoring and modeling of sea ice will be as important  in the next decade. The measurements and assets advocated for the Arctic, are similar to those  needed for the Antarctic, if available concurrently would facilitate significant advances in  Antarctic system science.

Q.2 Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Respondents were not asked to comment on the timeliness of proposed key questions/challenges.   Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new satellite observations, and facilitating the use of   satellite data.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Icesat-using GLAS on Icesat and Icesat-2 for measuring vegetation structure and biomass for   climate mitigation policy    Landsat for vegetation, water usage/quality, and fire data related to carbon, land cover, land   use/land cover (LU/LC) change, agriculture, and natural hazards. Landsat offers comprehensive   spatio-temporal advantages.    MODIS/VIIRS for vegetation, water usage/quality, fire, and air measurements, which are   relevant to carbon, agriculture, natural hazards, and air quality.    MODIS/AVHRR – have a long record of vegetation indices for monitoring phenology, climate   change, and landscape changes to inform climate policy and sustainable development.    Space-based LIDAR and SARs for vegetation, carbon, fire, and soil moisture data, which are   relevant to carbon, agriculture, and natural hazards.    More hyperspectral capabilities for vegetation, carbon, fire, soil moisture, which are relevant to   carbon, agriculture, and natural hazards.    Rosetta – Studying the solar system and comets in particular is increasingly important    Aqua – Ocean behavior is important in aviation and needs to be further studied    APM – for NRT forecasting—water and disasters    SMAP – soil moisture, drought monitoring, and food security    CO2 measurements    Sea level instrument    Climate meteorological satellites – precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, humidity, ocean   color, winds – are all important for tracking climate/human footprints    Monitoring of environmental gases and incoming radiation in the atmosphere     Whitepaper for Eastern and Southern Africa Hub Region  3    Population distribution    Land use, land morphology    High temporal and spatial resolution measurements of NDVI worldwide    TRMM/GPM – Rainfall data are critical for areas that have unreliable station data. Can provide a   climatology record for rainfall and is critical to monitoring and forecasting droughts and floods   for disaster risk mitigation.    GPM – Provides critical precipitation data useful for weather prediction, disaster risk   assessments, agriculture, ecosystems, hydrology models, and in fact all societal benefit areas.    Jason-1 to monitor water surface height    SeaWIFS – To improve the accuracy of ocean-water quality measurements    SRTM – Accurate and high-resolution elevation data are a universal input to improve   understanding of hydrological models   Suomi NPP-VIIRS-MODIS and VIIRS derived measurements are used worldwide by decision makers to   monitor forest fires, land cover, vegetation indices, and monitor air and water quality. Continuous   measurements of surface reflectance that help to generate other products are critical to monitor   ecosystems.   Suggestions for additional investments include:     A tool that takes inputs and predicts crop harvests in Africa – to support food security efforts in   the advent of a changing climate system    A one-stop-shop for all satellite observed or computed data for weather monitoring    Towards a safer world, a tool that can monitor terrorist groups and advise governments    Higher resolution data that can be freely distributed    High resolution (<10 m), daily observations with the spectral characteristics of MODIS, VIIRS, and   Landsat OLI to improve all application areas and inform all societal, thematic areas    Cloud-free data for coastal areas – overcoming the challenge of obtaining good datasets for   these areas    Biodiversity and Habitat Measurement required as an essential climate variable (ECV)    Evapotranspiration to be included as an ECV    Forecasted rainfall for flood forecasting and water resources forecasting    Groundwater monitoring/groundwater level datasets    Soil quality/fertility    In terms of new sensors, hyperspectral and radar sensors    In terms of products, surface reflectance products from the multispectral and hyperspectral   sensors    Radar data and technology    Open source coding packages along with raw and science-level data and products so regional   analyses could be more rapidly and efficiently completed in R, Python – reducing the need for   access to high power visualizations locally    New-NISAR – to obtain measurements on biomass    New-SWOT – to survey Earth's surface water    LIDAR – for vegetation structure and biomass to monitor forest degradation and inform land use   policy, mitigation policies, and protected area enforcement     Whitepaper for Eastern and Southern Africa Hub Region  4    Vegetation indices, rainfall estimates, radiation, atmospheric gases. These will guide decision   making in various sectors: Food security, health, power generation, etc.   A one-stop-shop for all satellite observed or computed data for weather monitoring would be ideal,   especially for Africa, where weather observations have been reduced and continue to decline. Besides   the minimal upper air observation equipment (the radiosonde), surface stations are also in a free-fall   mode.   Moderate resolution (~30 m) LU/LC change maps generated at regular intervals are key to informing   many policy decisions, including natural capital accounting, REDD+, and sustainable development. The   production of global forest cover maps on a yearly basis has already proven invaluable to REDD+   projects and informing land use and climate mitigation policies. The next step is generating change   products for non-forest habitats such as wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural areas. These datasets are   key for studies related to water security, food security, health, and sustainable development.   The phenology of NDVI is one of the most basic and important products that satellites provide to the   agriculture industry. MODIS is the only product with sufficient temporal resolution to be useful to   understanding plant growth phenology (central to understanding influence of climate change on   agriculture), but its spatial resolution is too low to be useful to most field/pasture-scale analyses.   In terms of new measurements, NISAR and SWOT will provide new understanding of our forests (NISAR)   and water resources (SWOT).   Climate change and people/demographers will affect development objectives. Products that can track   the interactions of climate and inconsistent population growth (spatially) will be critical.   In relation to food security, it is becoming increasingly important to monitor groundwater reservoirs and   soil fertility.   In the case of hyperspectral technology, such satellite capacity is needed on an operational basis to   continue the legacy of EO-1 Hyperion. Hyperspectral data can be used for a variety of applications; in   biodiversity and ecology a good signal to noise ratio product will support analyses to discriminate   species of interest from the surface coverage.    Radar is critically needed to acquire useful and timely, post-event data in water-related disasters. In   addition, radar technology is also needed to improve biomass estimations.   To increase the value of data and enable end users to fully understand satellite data and how it can be   used, it would be useful to provide:    Metadata (geographic scope, time series length)    Information on the uncertainty of satellite data    Byproducts, such as flood maps    A better understanding of product applications and limitations       ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":""}

Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new satellite observations, and facilitating the use of   satellite data.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Landsat, PATH, SWOT, TRMM, GPM, MODIS, JASON-3, ICESAT-2, SMOS    EO-1 Optical imagery (tasking is very important during disasters)    EOS for air quality and weather are extremely beneficial; singling out one is doing injustice to   others.   Global land observation missions, such as the Landsat series, are crucial to providing a long-term,   consistent perspective on global to local changes.   Hyperspectral and SAR continue to be research areas for NASA, but the immediate benefits range from   better water quality and ecosystem service assessment to situational awareness of hazards when   awareness is needed the most (not waiting for clouds to clear).   It is important to continue remote sensing in difficult terrain, such as the mountains and cryosphere.    These are places where in-situ measurements are lacking and where huge knowledge gaps exist. Cross   collaboration between different thematic groups is also important to develop better products.   Suggestions for additional investments include:     A global, data-driven indication of poverty to be used in connecting other environmental/   climate data to communities.    Air quality and weather related application for the HKH – model/satellite assimilated products.   The HKH is an extremely poor in-situ observation data region yet in dire need of information.   HKH is an aerosol pollution hotspot, impacting the cryosphere and monsoon, which affects not   only mountain people but almost a billion people downstream.    More near-real time weather monitoring applications to enhance early warning.    More vertical profile data like Calipso/MISR, or additional spatial and temporal resolutions from   them.       Whitepaper for Himalaya Hub Region   3    Access to commercial high-resolution imagery for disasters.    More real-time and higher resolution soil moisture measurements could provide better inputs   into drought, crop productivity, and hydro-meteorological hazards nowcasting and forecasting.    Improved access and interpretability of SAR for rapid response.    More assimilation of satellite data with model products, packaged into readily usable, timely   service systems, such as turnkey products/services addressing biodiversity, ecosystem services,   vegetation stress, productivity (food security).      A system to rapidly ingest EO data and provide easy access to the community (a range of   products exist, but there are few centralized ways to summarize capabilities, resulting in a   piecemeal approach and tools/data that are hard to find).    Altimetry provides key inputs into global circulation models as well as riverine flood forecasting.   Expansion of inland bodies of water covered would result in greater immediate benefit where   ground data are lacking.    Global DEMs that are updated every few years, at least 30 m spatial resolution; myriad   hydrological and surface process applications in agriculture, water management, and disaster   management.    Repeat dual or quad pole SAR will greatly enhance ecosystem monitoring, agricultural and   rangelands health, and situational awareness during disasters such as floods, oil spills,   landslides.    More customization and strengthening to address snow/ice depth, which helps to identify   precursors of hydrological dynamics, disaster vulnerability, upstream/downstream dynamics   across nations (water availability, life security).   A more dynamic and global digital elevation product will contribute to many of the thematic areas that   we address. At the global and macro-levels, elevation has been treated as a constant, but it is dynamic.    Looking at surface changes give us insight into groundwater levels for water resource management and   food security, surface deformation gives us insight into hazards that could turn into disasters, and DTM   and DSM can give us a better picture of carbon and biomass in critical ecosystems.   Future satellites launched should reflect NASA’s technologically innovative nature and push the   'envelope' of space missions – such as ones that yield higher resolution DEM (LIDAR scale), 24/7   microwave-accuracy precipitation from GEO platforms (PATH), good insight of surface water bodies and   its changes that we know so little about (SWOT).    Regarding tools, products, and datasets, NASA should not be in the business of trying to do everything,   but should provide easy access to remote sensing observations and the geophysical variables estimated   from them. It's the job of scientists and end users to build systems/tools of their own within their   framework to ensure sustainability. Taxpayer money should not be used trying to satisfy every single   product/tool that the wide range of users need. A self-sustaining ecosystem of users is required.   The mountains across the world serve natural resource regimes and control climate systems as well as   oceans and main land do. In the context of climate change and transboundary issues, the understanding   of mountain ecosystems requires utmost priority and importance. There is an urgent need to orient EO   efforts to characterize, monitor, and model mountain systems in the same way that oceans and   atmosphere are studied. The mountains support poverty ridden and ecologically vulnerable   communities. Current satellite based EO systems and associated products do help, to a limited extent, to     Whitepaper for Himalaya Hub Region   4   understand cryosphere dynamics and associated hydrology regimes, and erosion of ecosystem services.   To improve the ability of current ground sensor networks to monitor high altitude climatology,   atmospheric chemistry, and dispersion, the following improvements are suggested:    Improved satellite-based stereogramatic capabilities to understand /quantify snow and ice   depth.    Orient and customize sensors and products to better monitor and forecast mountain climate.    Satellite constellation systems to enhance repetitive cover to address disaster and resources   monitoring related aspects.    Short-term experimental, small satellites to study geophysical and biophysical mountain   complexities.    Sensor-satellite webs to address problems like flash floods and glacier melts.    High radiometric and increased spectral channels based systems to monitor ecosystem   processes like invasive species, stress, water quality, and productivity.    Synthesize, integrate, and develop operational Mountain Essential Variables similar to Essential   Climate Variables.   To increase the value of data and enable end users to fully understand satellite data and how it can be   used, it would be useful to provide:    Metadata (geographic scope, time series length)    Information on the uncertainty of satellite data    Customization for national needs          ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":""}

To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new satellite observations, and facilitating the use of   satellite data.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    ATom, Aura, CALIPSO, CLARREO, CloudSat, CYGNSS    GRACE – to support decision-making for water resource management    Landsat, GPM, Aqua, Terra, Jason – for Earth observations   o GPM provides high value to a broad range of users, and data streams are part of   systems that can save millions of lives from weather, water, disasters, and climate   events.   o Landsat provides high value to a broad range of users, and the historical archive offers   significant additional value to ongoing observations related to ecosystems, biodiversity,   water, agriculture, disasters, and health.    Hubble – for inspiration    International Space Station – for a desire for cooperation    Weather observations, especially accurate rainfall estimations, are crucial for forecasts and early   warning (e.g., of floods and landslides).   Continue satellite missions such as Landsat and MODIS (Level 1b/2), with free/easy operational   subscription access or even access within cloud computing infrastructure for rental, for efficient value-  added production chains.   Global land observation missions, such as the Landsat series, are crucial to providing a long-term,   consistent perspective on global to local changes.     Whitepaper for Lower Mekong Hub Region   3   Hyperspectral and SAR continue to be research areas for NASA, but the immediate benefits range from   better water quality and ecosystem service assessment to situational awareness of hazards when   awareness is needed the most (not waiting for clouds to clear).   Suggestions for additional investments include:     A high-resolution satellite (spatially and also temporal) whose data are freely and publicly   accessible and not subject to cloud cover.    Higher resolution topographic data would provide high value for a broad spectrum of users and   add value to many other products with respect to Water / Disasters / Ecosystems / Biodiversity /   Energy.    A “long-term” mission commitment to higher resolution multiband optical/multi-spectral   radiometry products (e.g., higher-res Landsat) would provide high value for a broad spectrum of   users, and is particularly critical as Earth surface changes accelerate – relevant to Agriculture /   Water / Disasters / Biodiversity / Climate / Ecosystems / Health.    Active instrument of SMAP – key for food security, agricultural forecasting and planning –   relevant to Agriculture / Water / Ecosystems / Health / Disasters.    More near-real time weather monitoring applications to enhance early warning.    Data related to weather and short/medium and long-range forecasts, to make them more   accurate at high resolution.    Altimetry provides key inputs into global circulation models as well as riverine flood forecasting.

Water management remains one of the major problems for the Lower Mekong. The region can   experience extreme drought in one year, and then very wet seasons the next year, often causing major   problems in the agriculture sector. An ability to predict, with acceptable accuracy, weather patterns     Whitepaper for Lower Mekong Hub Region   4   (e.g., storms, precipitation, etc.) over a medium term (e.g., one year) will help the region greatly in   managing water situations.   A more dynamic and global digital elevation product will contribute to many of the thematic areas that   we address. At the global and macro-levels, elevation has been treated as a constant, but it is dynamic.    Looking at surface changes offers insight into groundwater levels for water resource management and   food security, surface deformation gives us insight into hazards that could turn into disasters, and DTM   and DSM can provide a better picture of carbon and biomass in critical ecosystems.   There is a great need for accurate vertical elevation data all over the world and especially in less   developed countries. SRTM provides too coarse resolution and vertical accuracy is not good.  Airborne   solutions (LIDAR) are very costly.   To increase the value of data and enable end users to fully understand satellite data and how it can be   used, it would be useful to provide:    Metadata (geographic scope, time series length)    Information on the uncertainty of satellite data    Data latency    Investment should be made in the geo-database structure to increase the ability to extract all of   the above in automated ways.

Respondents were not asked to comment on the timeliness of proposed key questions/challenges.   Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new satellite observations, and facilitating the use of   satellite data.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Landsat must continue as the longest operating mission producing comparable data since the   1970s.    o Specifically, Landsat images at 7 and 8 pixel to 30 by 30 have been used for decision-  making.   o Landsat-type data are very useful for evaluating and managing natural resources.    Continue all missions involving the measurement of the variables described in the questions   above. For example:   o Landsat for vegetation, water usage/quality, and fire data related to carbon, agriculture,   natural hazards.   o MODIS/VIIRS for vegetation, water usage/quality, fire, and air measurements, which are   relevant to carbon, agriculture, natural hazards, and air quality.   o Space-based LIDAR and SARs for vegetation, carbon, fire, and soil moisture data, which   are relevant to carbon, agriculture, and natural hazards.   o More hyperspectral capabilities for vegetation, carbon, fire, and soil moisture, which are   relevant to carbon, agriculture, and natural hazards.    Satellite missions such as Landsat and MODIS (Level 1b/2) with free/easy operational   subscription access or even access within cloud computing infrastructure for rental for efficient   value-added production chains.   Landsat is critically needed to assess LU/LC change. Technological advances in classification of satellite   data have made it possible to derive fine-scale annual forest loss maps from Landsat data dating back to   2000 and, for some geographic areas, several years earlier. Longitudinal (time series) LU/LC data is   extremely valuable for identifying temporal patterns and drivers of LU/LC change, and for measuring the   effectiveness of forest conservation policies. Continued missions are needed to ensure the extension of   these longitudinal data.   Suggestions for additional investments include:     Images of RapidEye 5 by 5 square meter pixel sensor that will allow more details and could be   comparable to images of forest cover and land use.    More frequent medium-resolution data. For example, the resolution level of Landsat and its   availability at no cost make it invaluable in environmental studies, but its frequency of 16 days,     Whitepaper for Central America Hub Region   3     with the high probability of cloud cover limitation, reduces its usefulness in monitoring rapidly   changing phenomena.    Higher-resolution images (<30 m), available at lower or no cost, would improve our capability of   studying changes at a finer scale.    High-resolution (<10 m), daily observations with the spectral characteristics of MODIS, VIIRS,   and Landsat OLI to improve all application areas and inform all societal, thematic areas.    High spatial resolution (<1 m).    Ability to predict extreme weather events over longer periods of time.    Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas monitoring (emission and sequestration).    Maps of threats and risks to decision-makers at local, regional, and national levels, and   dissemination of threats for decision-making.    Detailed data on the distribution of air contaminants.    A tool that not only allows users to download data from NASA but also allows users to perform   another type of analysis and modeling – to be a `one stop shop.`    Open source coding packages along with raw and science-level data and products so regional   analyses could be more rapidly and efficiently completed in R, Python – reducing the need for   access to high-power visualizations locally.    Earth observations – multispectral, including thermal, and 30 m or less resolution, with weekly   or more often return.   Moderate resolution (~30 m) LU/LC change maps generated at regular intervals are key to informing   many policy decisions, including natural capital accounting, REDD+, and sustainable development. The   production of global forest cover maps on a yearly basis has already proven invaluable to REDD+   projects and informing land use and climate mitigation policies. The next step is generating change   products for non-forest habitats such as wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural areas. These datasets are   key for studies related to water security, food security, health, and sustainable development.   It would be extremely valuable to have an enhanced capability to accurately measure forest   disturbance/degradation and forest biomass at a fine spatial and temporal scale. Forest   disturbance/degradation is at least as important as forest loss in explaining losses in forest ecosystem   services. And biomass is, of course, needed to measure carbon storage and emissions.   To increase the value of data and enable end users to fully understand satellite data and how it can be   used, it would be useful to provide:    Metadata (geographic scope, time series length)    Information on the uncertainty of satellite data    A platform that makes it easy to integrate maps, geodata, models, and pictures.    The ability for users to integrate local layers with satellite information available online.    The opportunity for users to interact with national and regional experts from NASA.

Kavaya (NASA Langley Research Center), Dr. Upendra N. Singh (NASA   Langley Research Center), Dr. G. David Emmitt (Simpson Weather Associates), and Prof. T. N.   Krishnamurti (Florida State University)      The Science   The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has long desired global measurement of   horizontal winds, listing specific measurement requirements for the lower and upper troposphere   and stratosphere for the application areas of numerical weather prediction (NWP), aeronautical   meteorology, climate, and others  [WMO (2012), WMO (2015)]. In a recent paper, the WMO lists   “wind speed and direction” in a list of essential variables to improve understanding of climate   research [Bojinski et al (2014)]. In the US, NASA, NOAA, DOD, and other agencies place high   priority on improving weather forecasts including predictions of severe weather; and they agree   that global wind measurements would provide a transformational improvement. Many studies,   including Observing System Simulation Studies (OSSEs) have shown the significant impact on   NWP and severe weather such as hurricanes that would be made by global winds [e.g., Masutani   et al (2010), Ma et al (2015), Atlas et al (2015)]. The space agencies of the US, Europe, Japan,   India, and other countries have all expressed a need for wind measurements. The 2007 NRC “Earth   Science Decadal Survey” recognized this need and advocated a “3-D Winds” mission [NRC   (2007)].      The Space Mission and Preferred Technology Solution   Studies and simulations of global wind missions began in 1978 and have continued to this day.   NASA and NOAA scientists have concluded that the best technology to perform this mission with   the lowest cost and risk is a pulsed hybrid Doppler wind lidar system [Baker et al (1995), Valinia   et al (2006), Baker et al (2014)]. The pulsed hybrid Doppler lidar concept was proposed in 2001   [Emmitt (2001)].  A hybrid Doppler wind lidar system is comprised of two lidars receiving signal     from aerosols and molecules, both moving with the wind, for vertical coverage of the atmosphere.   Most of the NASA-NOAA studies used coherent-detection lidar at 2-micron wavelength for   aerosols, and direct-detection lidar at 0.355-microns wavelength (UV) for molecules.   Relative to direct lidar, the coherent or heterodyne lidar provides very accurate measurements with   fewer received photons and a smaller optical receiver diameter, and hence lower laser input   electrical power and heat removal [Wu et al (2013)]. The efficiency and accuracy is a consequence   of being only required to estimate frequencies with digitized data in a computer. Physics Nobel   laureate Charles Townes has stated “It is perhaps not obvious that heterodyne detection can in   principle achieve precision in determining a wave’s properties that is limited only by the basic   uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. However, this is the case,” [Johnson and Townes   (2000)]. However, the atmosphere has greatly varying concentrations of aerosols, generally   decreasing with increasing altitude. As the aerosol concentration falls below a threshold, the   probability of a usable measurement decreases.   Relative to coherent lidar, the direct lidar requires more received photons and hence greater optical   receiver diameter, and greater laser input power and heat removal; and makes a less accurate   measurement since the Brownian motion of the air molecules has much higher velocities than the   aerosol Brownian motion. However, the air molecules are found at all altitudes under all weather   conditions, allowing the direct lidar to continue to make measurements where the coherent wind   lidar does not. Since the molecular backscattered light intensity scales as the inverse of the   wavelength to the fourth power (Rayleigh scattering), the short UV wavelength is required for   adequate signal.   Space mission studies at NASA have shown that trying to cover the atmosphere vertically with   either coherent or direct lidar alone entails greater development risk and spacecraft resources than   a hybrid lidar.   Considerable progress has been made in the US over the last decade with both coherent and direct   wind lidar technology for space. Coherent lidar at 2 microns is being developed at NASA Langley   Research Center for aerosols. Direct lidar is being developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight   Center at 0.355 microns for molecules, and at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. at 0.532   microns for aerosols. All three lidars have advanced to aircraft flights. ESA has invested even more   than the US in advancing direct lidar. Therefore, the “3-D Winds” mission no longer belongs in   Tier 3.      The Pulsed UV Laser in Space Challenge   ESA is developing the first earth-orbiting Doppler wind lidar system called the Atmospheric   Dynamics Mission (ADM), a direct detection lidar at 0.355 microns with a 1.5-m-diameter   receiver mirror. Due to the mirror size, ADM will aim its laser in only one direction and provide   only line-of-sight (LOS) winds. This will be exciting data but will not provide the desired vector   horizontal winds. ESA has struggled with the energetic UV photons damaging optical components   due to contamination, and ADM had its launch delayed so far from 2007 to 2016. The recent US     space mission CATS suffered very fast failure of the UV light output [(McGill et al (2014)], and   the UV light is probably the cause of laser degradation of the US LITE space mission [Stadler   (1996)]. The contamination comes from outgassing due to vacuum, and floating material due to   weightlessness. ESA has spent a lot of money and over 10 years working on this UV problem.      The Way Forward From Here   When a wind-profiling lidar is performing from satellite altitudes, the payoffs for weather and   climate forecasts, and for understanding will provide a new dimension. We will have a detailed   description of four-dimensional winds around rain-producing intense systems. Data assimilation,   the most important component of modeling, will have an unprecedented coverage of winds leading   to improvements for weather and climate forecasts. This is what is needed for addressing the   extreme rains, winds, and floods.   We recommend the “3-D Winds” mission should move up from Tier 3. The 3 US groups should   be funded to continue demonstration of reliable aircraft operation including agreement with other   wind sensors, to show space qualification of the technology, and to communicate the path for the   technology to space.   An option that will reduce NASA’s cost and risk in implementing the “3-D Winds” mission is to   partner with ESA. NASA could provide the coherent wind lidar for aerosols, and ESA could   provide the direct wind lidar for molecules using all the lessons learned and capability developed   for ADM. In addition, both JAXA and ISRO have indicated a willingness to partner with NASA   in providing the 2-micron coherent lidar; which will further reduce NASA’s cost.      References   R.

A key science question is how will Arctic cloud and aerosol respond to and interact with Arctic sea ice loss. The rapid nature of Arctic climate change makes this question and the need for continued and improved satellite measurements extremely timely.  Introduction  The Arctic is undergoing rapid climate change altering natural and human systems globally. These changes are exemplified by the unprecedented decline in Arctic sea ice—September sea ice extent trend of -13% per decade—and increase in Arctic surface temperature—more than twice the global rate. The loss of Arctic sea ice, land ice, and snow cover is accelerating Arctic and global warming through enhanced absorption of solar energy. The shrinking mass of land ice and snow is contributing to rising seas impacting coastal communities around the world. More than just sea level rise, flooding oceans with freshwater and altering the atmospheric temperatures may be impacting oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns. Further, thawing permafrost resulting form warmer Arctic temperatures is triggering the collapse of building, roads, and bridges.  Rapid Arctic warming is expected to have additional cascading effects with potentially severe consequences. Shorter winters suggest longer wildfire seasons across the boreal forests releasing additional carbon. Thawing permafrost could potentially release billions of tons of carbon and methane per year into the atmosphere over the next century. In light of these major concerns, a near-term focus on understanding the causes and impacts of rapid Arctic climate change is paramount. Clouds and aerosols are an important but highly uncertain component of the Arctic climate with the potential to amplify or dampen these rapid changes.   What is a key science question?  There are many scientific questions relating to rapid Arctic climate change with implications for human systems. A key science question is how will Arctic clouds respond to the significant loss and expected sea ice-free Arctic summers in the coming decades and how will the Arctic respond to cloud changes? This is an important science question because there is an indication that climate models simulate an unrealistically large cloud response to sea ice loss (e.g., Kay et al. 2010) producing a low bias in Arctic warming projections. The low bias results from the enhanced reflection of solar radiation by clouds offsetting a portion of the ice albedo feedback. Observational evidence suggests that low clouds weakly respond to sea ice loss in autumn, but not in summer (Kay and Gettelman 2009; Taylor et al. 2015). Despite this observational evidence, the physical mechanisms governing the interactions between sea ice and clouds and the interaction with the large-scale dynamics are not understood. Therefore, we cannot explain why clouds weakly respond to sea ice loss or physically represent such interaction in climate models.  The response of Arctic clouds to aerosol changes is a complicating factor when studying the cloud-sea ice relationship. Summertime sea ice loss would lead to large increases in aerosol and precursor gas emissions from the ocean. This increase may lead to increased cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) impacting cloud microphysics and lifetime; however, the end result is not clear given competing warming and cooling aerosol indirect effects. Additional impacts from anthropogenic aerosols associated with long range transport, increased ship traffic, black carbon deposits on snow further complicate studies of future Arctic conditions. Our poor understanding of these processes requires additional measurements and research to quantify the aerosol-cloud-sea ice Arctic climate feedbacks.    Why is this challenge timely?  It is timely to address this challenge from several perspectives. First, rapid Arctic climate change is influencing society now and observations are needed to inform adaptation and mitigation activities. Secondly, the Arctic is undergoing a potentially irreversible shift. We are on a “gradient” in the Arctic climate and this time period of rapid change may reveal interactions between the ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere that may never be observable again. Not studying this problem now would be a missed opportunity. A few climate models indicate that sea ice-free Arctic summers as early as the 2030s whereas most models suggest a higher probability of sea ice-free summers in the 2050s (Snape and Forster 2014). Therefore, the Arctic will not stay in this transition state between extensive, multi-year sea ice and much less extensive first-year sea ice without ice-free summers for long. Capturing the physics during this transition is an ephemeral opportunity that if seized can improve projections of the Arctic and global climate. With regards to readiness, many observational capabilities to address Arctic sea ice-cloud-aerosol interactions are available but need to be extended (e.g., active remotely sensed cloud and aerosol information). An integrated and comprehensive observing strategy including satellite, ground, and airborne observing platforms is necessary for understanding aerosol-cloud-sea ice interaction; not all components can be constrained from space.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing this question? Are existing and planned U.S. and international programs sufficient to enable substantial progress?  Unraveling the interactions between Arctic sea ice, clouds, and aerosols requires synergism between atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice observations and modeling. Space-based observations are very important to this problem because satellites are the only platform available to provide the required spatial information and consistent, long-term record of the critical variables.  There are a wide of range of observed quantities needed to constrain sea ice-cloud interaction. Key quantities for measurement include temperature and humidity throughout the cloud field at high vertical resolution, especially below cloud base. High vertical resolution is necessary to determine the connection between the cloud layer and the surface and cloud top inversion characteristics. Cloud and aerosol information is necessary including cloud microphysical measurements (phase partitioning, total water content, hydrometeor size distribution), cloud dynamical/turbulence measurements (e.g., vertical motion), and aerosol and CCN measurements (e.g., size distribution, composition, IN vs. CCN, ‘Arctic Haze’). Surface characteristics must also be defined including sea ice state (sea ice extent, concentration, and thickness), ocean state (temperature and mixed layer depth), and surface turbulent fluxes (latent and sensible heat fluxes). Knowledge of large-scale meteorological state is also critical for constraining the aerosol-cloud-sea ice relationships, which is generally obtained from poorly constrained meteorological reanalysis.  Current satellite information enables progress on this problem but is insufficient to solve it. Microwave radiometer retrieved sea ice information (extent and concentration) and active remotely sensed (e.g., CALIPSO/CloudSat) cloud and aerosol properties are being used to investigate cloud-sea ice interactions at interannual and cloud process timescales. However, standard backscatter lidars lack the calibration required to detect the tenuous but vertically extensive background aerosol—e.g., ‘Arctic Haze’. Passive remote sensing cloud information and atmospheric reanalysis, which assimilates satellite data, are not reliable enough to make substantial progress on this problem. Further, current satellite instruments cannot provide lower tropospheric temperature and humidity profiles (below ~3 km) of sufficient accuracy and vertical resolution (better than ~100m near the surface and inversion). Lastly, surface latent and sensible heat fluxes at the required accuracy levels to constrain the cloud response are not available. We are skeptical that existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress. As implied above, active satellite-based remote sensing instruments are providing high quality observations of Arctic clouds and aerosols. After EarthCARE no plans appear to exist for a mission capable of extending the vertical cloud and aerosol distribution record, as the status of ACE seems uncertain. A long-term and continuous active remote sensing record of Arctic/global clouds and aerosols (e.g., CALIPSO/CloudSAT synergy) is needed to track changes in cloud properties, cloud vertical distributions, and aerosol to inform cloud process and climate model studies. However, the need to ask interdisciplinary science questions that incorporate ocean ecosystems and aerosols into the cloud-sea ice interaction problem is on the horizon and requires more accurate measurements of Arctic aerosol and complementary measurements of ocean productivity (e.g., plankton distributions) that can be provided by the high spectral resolution lidar technique.  How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key science question and societal needs?  Satellite-based instruments are not able to resolve the cloud-sea ice interaction problem alone. As stated previously, an integrated and comprehensive observing strategy including satellite, ground, and airborne observing platforms is required. Satellite capabilities to address the sea ice-cloud interaction problem can be enhanced with carefully designed airborne campaigns and surface observing stations on land, sea, or ice. Value can be added to satellite observations by simultaneously observing the necessary components of the ocean-atmosphere-sea ice system during extensive airborne field campaigns over different Arctic regions sampling diverse large-scale environments and sea ice conditions.  Involved Science communities  The science communities directly involved in the question of sea ice-cloud interactions includes atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean communities. However, the broader context of rapid Arctic climate change also includes the ecological and land ice. Rapid Arctic climate change is an important question within all Earth Science as the impacts from these changes will influence global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and the science questions of concern in other regions.  Anticipated scientific and societal benefits  Anticipated science value of studying aerosol-cloud-sea ice relationships is better knowledge of the processes that drive rapid Arctic climate change. This information will be useful for constraining climate model physics and projections. Constraining climate projections will be useful to society, enabling a better assessment of Arctic climate change impacts on the global system including sea level rise, ecosystems, and extreme weather. In many respects, resolving Arctic climate change uncertainty will enable progress on many other climate science problems including sea level rise, atmosphere and ocean circulation change, and global temperature change.

Background  Radiative energy from the Sun establishes the basic climate of the Earth’s surface and  atmosphere and defines the terrestrial environment that supports all life on the planet. Solar  radiation, nearly four orders of magnitude larger than all other external sources of energy, fuels  atmospheric dynamics and chemistry along with photosynthetic processes in the biosphere, and  drives interactions among the atmosphere, oceans, ice, and land. External solar variability on a  wide range of scales ubiquitously affects the Earth system, and combines with internal forcings,  including anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, and natural modes such as  ENSO, and volcanic forcing, to define past, present, and future climates. Understanding these  effects requires continuous measurements of total and spectrally resolved solar irradiance that  meet the stringent requirements of climate-quality accuracy and stability over time.   The current uninterrupted 37-year total solar irradiance (TSI) climate data record is the result of  several overlapping instruments flown on different missions. This record clearly exhibits  variability over the 11-year solar cycle and on shorter time scales. (Note that the current solar  cycle 24 exhibits the lowest level of solar activity since the start of the satellite era.)  Measurement continuity, required to link successive instruments to the existing data record to  discern long-term trends despite calibration offsets between instruments, makes this important  climate data record susceptible to loss in the event of a gap in measurements. While  improvements in future instrument accuracy may reduce the risk of a gap, a timely 2017 launch  of TSIS-1 to the International Space Station (ISS) followed by TSIS-2 in 2022 will ensure  continuity of the solar irradiance record well into the next decade.  A newer record of solar spectral irradiance (SSI) commenced with the launch of the Solar  Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) in 2003. The measurement of SSI is fundamental to  interpreting how the atmosphere responds solar variability, identifying the physical mechanisms  of response, and validating climate model sensitivity to spectrally varying solar forcing. These  data also provide a basis for improving proxy-derived solar spectral models, which can be used  to simulate past climate states and validate hypotheses on past and future climate change.          2   2. Key Challenges for Earth System Science  At the core of the objectives that define the requirements for continued measurements of solar  irradiance from space are these questions from the NASA Science Mission Directorate Science  Plan [2014]:      How is the global Earth system changing?  What are the sources of change in the Earth system and their magnitudes and trends?  How will the Earth system change in the future?     Answering these questions relies on a climate observing system capable of unambiguously  distinguishing long-term trends from internal variability and attributing the causes to their  underlying physical mechanisms [Wielicki et al., 2013]. Solar irradiance is one cornerstone of  such an observing system, providing the only source of external energy that is balanced, or not,  at the outer boundaries of the atmosphere by reflected solar radiation and Earth’s emission.   One of the greatest challenges to the continuity of the solar irradiance record is the same one  facing all other space-based observations: how does the nation prioritize its investments in Earth  Science space assets? In particular, climate change monitoring that relies on sustained and highly  accurate and stable measurements over long periods of time must be balanced with other  programmatic goals within NASA and other agencies – this was the theme of the recently  published National Research Council (NRC) Report on Continuity of NASA Earth Observations  from Space: A Value Framework [2015]. The value-based decision approach recommended in  that report provides the basis for meeting the challenge of maintaining continuity of the solar  irradiance data record and is covered in the following sections.    2.1 Existing and Planned Capabilities and New Investments   The current implementations for solar irradiance monitoring will secure the near-term data  record if they proceed as planned. SORCE, launched in 2003 to measure TSI and SSI, is now in  its seventh year of extended mission with an ailing battery that limits it to it to a daytime-only  operations mode. In the event that SORCE should fail before TSIS-1 launches in 2017, the Joint  Polar Satellite System (JPSS) deployed the TSI Calibration Transfer Experiment (TCTE) in 2013  to connect the SORCE and TSIS TSI calibration scales; NOAA has extended TCTE, originally a  one-year mission, to December 2017 in order to overlap with TSIS [Woods et al., 2014]. The  impact of a gap in the TSI record has been studied and quantified in two separate studies [Kopp  and Lean, 2011; 2013] and the implementation of TCTE was recommended in the NRC Report  on Evaluating NOAA’s plan to Mitigate the Loss of Total Solar Irradiance Measurements from  Space [2013]. These studies provided quantifiable metrics that can help assess both the quality  and relative value of solar irradiance measurements as recommended in the recent NRC report  Continuity of NASA Earth Observations [2015].  The next leg of the solar irradiance measurement record will follow the five-year TSIS-1in the  2022 time frame. In FY2016 TSIS will be transferred from NOAA to NASA and plans for the  follow-on mission, TSIS-2, will commence. Considering that the ISS is currently extended to  operate only through 2024, now is the time for developing and investing in the framework that  ensures solar irradiance data continuity well into the future while meeting the challenges that  NASA faces within its Earth-observing portfolio.           3   New and highly capable small spacecraft bus designs, the roll out of small low-cost launch  vehicles, and a 25-year plan to provide continuous and overlapping TSI and SSI data records are  all components of a low risk/high reliability implementation plan with lower annual cost than  past concepts. Such a model also adheres to the recommendations in Earth Science and  Applications from Space: A Midterm Assessment of National Imperatives for the Next Decade  and Beyond [NRC, 2012] for new, highly flexible observing and implementation strategies for  observing the Earth system. We recommend that this small satellite approach for solar  irradiance data continuity be given high priority in the new Decadal Survey.   2.2 Links to Other Observations   Solar irradiance continuity is fundamental to assessing Earth’s radiative energy budget and  therefore, is directly linked to the current Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  (CERES) and future Radiation Budget Instrument (RBI) measurements of outgoing Earth  radiation from space. Moreover, surface monitoring networks and airborne science missions that  monitor the surface and in situ energy budgets, respectively, provide the necessary connections  to the incoming solar energy. High accuracy solar irradiance measurements will also provide on- orbit calibration of Earth-viewing climate sensors as well as SI-traceability for inter-calibration  of a host of other sensors as described in Wielicki et al. [2013] and Lukashin et al. [2015].    2.3 Scientific and Societal Benefits  Quantifying the relative contributions to climate change requires accurate knowledge of all of the  terms in Earth’s energy budget, of which the Sun is the overwhelmingly dominant source. In a  2005 congressional briefing on recent climate change, University of Massachusetts Professor  Raymond Bradley stated that trying to understand the Earth’s climate without measuring the  Sun’s output is “… like trying to balance your checkbook when you don’t know what your  income is - it’s very hard to do.”  Because of its inherent value to climate science, the continued monitoring of solar irradiance will  help guide policy decisions in the response, mitigation, and adaptation to climate change.  When  data are not available or lack the required accuracy and stability, confusion and misinformation  abound. Claims about the Sun’s role in the past century’s observed climate anomalies without  the data to back them up obstruct the scientific process and muddy the waters in establishing the  role of humans in climate change.    2.4 Science Communities Involved  Fundamental objectives related to solar irradiance monitoring extend to a broad science  community that includes studies on Earth energy budget, process-oriented remote sensing  applications, climate and atmospheric modeling, and atmospheric composition. Note that  because most General Circulation Models (GCMs) and weather models now extend from the  surface to 80 km or higher, solar spectral irradiance is now an essential input – the evidence  clearly demonstrates that having a proper stratosphere improves terrestrial forecasts. Long-term  solar irradiance monitoring is also relevant to heliophysics research and space weather operations  [Denig et al., 2015].              4   3. Timeliness of Addressing the Challenges   There are both scientific and programmatic motivations for addressing the challenges of  maintaining the solar irradiance data record over the coming decade. The science rests on well- founded requirements of establishing a trusted climate observing network that can monitor trends  in fundamental climate variables – is this case, the energy available for the entire Earth system.  Programmatically, the continuous and long-term monitoring of solar irradiance must be balanced  within the broader goals of NASA Earth Science. New concepts for a low-risk, cost efficient  observing strategy to maintain the solar irradiance record for decades to come should be a  priority in the new Decadal Survey.    4. The Need for Space-based Observations   The requirements for a climate-quality data record of solar irradiance prohibit the measurements  from anywhere but space. Corrections for atmospheric extinction from high altitude  observatories and even from aircraft and balloon measurements far exceed baseline requirements  for TSIS accuracy and stability. The continuous monitoring achievable only from space also  mitigates sampling anomalies and helps separate solar trends from instrument degradation.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in   the coming decade?      One of the challenges for Earth System Science in the next decade is to improve the   understanding of aerosol processes and properties in order to decrease uncertainties in   estimates of global and regional aerosol radiative effects at the top of atmosphere, at the   surface, and throughout the column.      Aerosols affect Earth’s climate directly, by scattering and absorbing solar  radiation, and indirectly by altering the lifetime and development of clouds, which in turn   affect the scattering and absorption of radiation. Uncertainties associated with aerosol   radiative forcing (ARF) estimates are among the leading causes of discrepancies in   climate simulations and complicate Earth System studies that increasingly depend on   understanding how atmospheric composition and its anthropogenic disturbances interact   with other components of the Earth system. Therefore, detailed and accurate global   aerosol measurements are required to better understand shortwave radiative transfer and   to ultimately reduce climate change prediction uncertainties.    The latest IPCC model-based ARF estimate of radiative forcing due to aerosol– radiation interactions is –0.35 (–0.85 to +0.15) W/m2. However, there remains  considerable observational as well as recent modeling evidence that the actual uncertainty   is a factor of two to four larger. Simply doubling the estimated uncertainty range would     have a large impact on estimates of climate sensitivity and future predictions of surface   temperature associated with climate change.     Reducing the uncertainty in direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) is a necessary   step in reconciling estimates of radiative forcing and the equilibrium climate sensitivity   of the Earth so that future predictions of surface temperature associated with climate   change can be made with confidence. In particular, providing better observational   constraints on anthropogenic aerosols and their microphysical properties, as represented   in models, would significantly reduce uncertainty in DARF estimates. Quantitative   improvement in DARF estimates will in turn increase confidence in estimating the   sensitivity of the climate system to forcing by greenhouse gases. Furthermore, the top-of-  atmosphere DARF estimate alone is insufficient to determine aerosol forcing at the   surface and within the atmosphere; vertically resolved measurements are necessary to   fully characterize DARF. The former affects processes such as photosynthesis and   evapotranspiration, and the latter is critical to understanding how atmospheric heating by   absorbing aerosols affects atmospheric stability structure, cloud development,   atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns.   The NASA Science Mission Directorate Workshop conducted in May 2014   (https://espo.nasa.gov/home/content/NASA_SMD_Workshop; hereafter the SMD   whitepaper) identified aerosol impacts on Earth’s radiation budget as a critical science  area, and endorsed the fundamental science and observational requirements put forth in   the NASA Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) mission recommended by the 2007   Decadal Survey. In particular, the SMD whitepaper targets reduction in ARF   uncertainties as a key community objective. Current A-Train measurements are   insufficient to constrain the aerosol properties needed to reduce these uncertainties.   Layer-resolved aerosol absorption, targeted by the ACE mission to derive accurate   heating rates and quantify semi-direct effects of aerosols, is notably absent from   quantitative A-Train capabilities and so is among the highest priority aerosol   measurements identified in the SMD whitepaper.   The ACE strategy is to produce a comprehensive data set of three-dimensional   aerosol optical (e.g. scattering, absorption) and microphysical (e.g. size, composition via   refractive index) properties as a function of time and location to constrain global model   ARF estimates.  ACE would provide firm global and regional DARF estimates and   uncertainties by confronting issues not adequately addressed by previous observations   along with the first ever measurement-based estimate of the global direct aerosol   radiative forcing at the bottom of the atmosphere to within ± 1 W/m2. This is equivalent   to estimating the global surface evaporation rate of ± 1 mm/month (~ 1% of global rates).     Fully understanding the role of aerosol in the climate system fundamentally   requires understanding what determines current and future spatial and temporal aerosol   distributions. In particular, this requires characterizing key sources, sinks and transport   pathways of primary atmospheric aerosol properties and types, and determining the   impact of aerosol events on the local, regional and global aerosol burden and air quality.    Although aerosols are locally or regionally generated, long-range transport of   dust, pollution, and biomass burning aerosols contributes significantly to the aerosol   loading in many locations. Severe aerosol pollution events and even background   exposure are responsible for a range of chronic and acute respiratory ailments, causing an   estimated two million premature deaths per year.  About half of this mortality occurs in      developing countries; however, even the average European loses 8.6 months of life   expectancy due to exposure to fine particulate matter.    ACE measurements will better constrain global aerosol transport models.   Determining aerosol source, sink, and transport properties requires synthesizing   observations and global transport models, but evaluating how these models portray   aerosol characteristics is also vital for reducing climate change simulation uncertainties   and assessing and predicting air quality. The international Aerosol Comparisons between   Observations and Models (AeroCom, http://aerocom.met.no/) project has involved most   global aerosol modeling groups internationally over the past decade, providing a common   framework for evaluation of global aerosol models and enhancing connections to aerosol   data providers. AeroCom model intercomparisons of global mean aerosol optical   thickness (AOT) typically match the values observed by satellites to within the satellite   product uncertainties. However, AeroCom intercomparisons also revealed the wide   diversity in how models estimate AOT, showing far less consensus on how models   represent aerosol composition, particle size, and vertical profiles even when similar   emission functions are used.  In addition, the manner in which models use AOT to   compute radiative forcing, which depends not only on aerosol distributions but also on   the particle microphysical properties, is completely unconstrained on the global scale.   Regional and seasonal distributions also show large diversity among models and between   models and observations. These uncertainties lead to large differences in how models   represent radiative heating rates and aerosol-cloud interactions, identify anthropogenic   components, and assess the direct aerosol effect associated with long-term changes in   aerosol distributions.     This model performance diversity exists largely because suitable measurements to   constrain specific processes in the model simulations are lacking. Advanced global   transport models now simulate aerosol mass, number, and size distributions for multiple   aerosol compositions,  modes, shapes and mixtures, so aerosol characterization now   requires additional measurements beyond AOT or simple qualitative aerosol type   descriptions. Specifically, layer-resolved aerosol composition to distinguish   anthropogenic and natural aerosol components was identified as the second of two   highest-priority aerosol measurements identified in the SMD report.  Consequently, the   ACE concept seeks to constrain model assumptions with satellite-derived estimates of   source strength and location, vertical distribution, and distributions of AOT, mass,   number, and composition, integrated with detailed measurements acquired from   suborbital measurements.       2.   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect   to readiness?       Today the sensors aboard the A-Train and Terra satellites provide quantitative   distributions of aerosol optical thickness in the horizontal, and retrievals of aerosol   extinction profiles, as well as limited semi-quantitative information on aerosol   absorption, size, and shape.  However, the accuracy of these retrievals and even the   ability to identify general aerosol air mass type in some circumstances, are insufficient   for many climate- and health-related applications.  For example, current satellite sensors      measurements of AOT are inadequate to narrow DARF uncertainty estimates for climate   change simulations.     Estimates of daytime aerosol vertical distribution are noisy, requiring spatial   averaging that severely degrades horizontal resolution. Currently, there are no direct   satellite measurements of aerosol extinction profiles.  Other aerosol properties   (absorption, size and shape) are difficult to measure in all situations from space with   current instruments and are prone to large uncertainties. Determination of aerosol   composition and anthropogenic fraction from space is based largely on assumptions   rather than quantitative measurements.  Aerosol retrievals from current passive space-  based instruments degrade in the vicinity of clouds. Finally, EOS satellites have long   since exceeded their design lifetimes and the A-train is expected to disband in the next   few years.    The NASA ACE Pre-formulation Study played a major role in developing and   demonstrating new satellite and sub-orbital instruments and advanced retrieval   algorithms for answering these questions. Suborbital instruments inspired by ACE have   already begun acquiring these new datasets during recent airborne field missions   sponsored by NASA and other U.S. agencies.  These new instruments have demonstrated   the capability to provide unprecedented measurements of both column and layer resolved   aerosol properties required to meet the objectives described above.  The lidar, radar,   polarimeter and ocean sensor technology that comprises ACE’s core measurement suite  is expected to reach a technological readiness level that will permit ACE to go in full   formulation phase by the time the 2017 Decadal Survey Report is published.      3.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     Aerosols originate from a wide variety of both natural (desert dust; sea spray;   biogenic sulfate, nitrate, and carbonaceous particles; wildfire smoke; and volcanic ash)   and anthropogenic (domestic, industrial, and transportation-related combustion, land use   change, such as draining water resources, over-grazing, construction, and agricultural   burning) sources. Consequently, they exhibit an exceedingly wide range of light   absorption and scattering properties, chemical compositions, shapes, atmospheric   lifetimes, and spatial distributions. Within the troposphere, aerosol lifetimes are typically   about a week, so that aerosol amount and composition vary dramatically with space, time,   and altitude. Only satellite measurements can provide the frequent, global coverage   necessary for characterizing and quantifying this variability. Satellite measurements   already provide critical data for studying aerosol impacts on the global energy budget,   long range transport, aerosol model validation and assimilation, and air quality. Similarly,   satellite measurements of the global distribution of aerosol absorption, composition, and   size obtained from the ACE instruments would provide the constraints for reducing   model diversity and climate simulation uncertainty.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Here we address a key challenge of operations in the coming decade.  We introduce this challenge by reviewing how we arrived at our current state.  NASA has correctly identified two big questions permeating all of Earth Science research.  (1) What is the current state of the global Earth System, and (2) How is the global Earth system changing now as well as in the future? At the heart of these questions is the concept of a global Earth system, a holistic view of Earth’s lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and atmosphere, and humanity’s role as embedded in this system.  This concept of the Earth System is relatively new, originating and evolving within NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth in the 1980s, the Earth Observing System (EOS) of the 1990s and 2000s, and continuing into the present day.  Conceptualizing the Earth as a system led to the creation of all-encompassing satellite missions with flagship satellites carrying multiple sensors, accompanied by focused PI-led instruments. At the same time, this effort led to a successful ground-based infrastructure to receive, process, analyze, interpret, and disseminate the information and science derived from these missions.  The NASA concept of an Earth system has resulted in the resounding use of Terra and the A-Train data, a global community that expects free and easy access to web-based data, and modeling infrastructure that includes assimilation, sub-orbital validation assets and networks. Together, all facets have led to an explosion of scientific output leading to a better understanding of our planet and the forces acting upon it.  It is 2015 now.  Where do we stand?    To continue the scientific momentum generated by EOS, it is imperative to continue and expand the vision of the Earth as a system and employ a wide array of coincident measurement-based missions.  One solution is to continue obtaining a wide array of measurements with “big” (EOS-like) or even “moderate” (Venture class-like) missions.  Flagship missions that combine several important sensors and look for synthesis between measurements are an excellent strategy to meeting many key scientific goals.  Such strategy would be obvious if cost were no object.  But cost is always a factor, and seems to be increasingly so.  There is a limit to how many flagship missions can fit within budget, and with the specialization of research communities, someone is not going to get what they need. Since the need for measurements is nearly unlimited, the key challenge is  to maximize global observations and keep within a budget. Long-term measurements (climate quantities) continue to be important, but one size really does not fit all research and operational needs.   The current Earth Science program of supplementing large flagship missions with lower cost, competitively selected Earth Venture missions, instruments and sub-orbital programs has been essential to provide the wide array of data needed.   We propose here to add a “Micro” Satellite program to the mix in the range between 1 to 100kg size.  The idea would be to enhance flexibility, increase capability and keep costs down.   2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Building a space-worthy instrument is hard, but creating one for scientific use (calibrations, stability, etc) is even more difficult. Creating one that can fit within the dimensions of a micro spacecraft requires another level of complexity. When the micro satellite and Cubesat programs began, the emphasis was on education and the instruments were essentially toys.  The next generation of micro-satellites was able to provide useable scientific data on space science such as space weather.  Now, we are entering an era when these instruments are being built for Earth science applications.    The first to see the potential of pointing micro-satellites at the Earth have been private ventures, like Google or Planet Labs. They are currently using fleets of satellites equipped with simple imagers to take qualitative pictures from space. This is only the beginning.    There is no question that NASA has been preparing for this opportunity through the Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) and its InVEST program.  This program has invested in several micro-satellite projects, and the first set is reaching conclusion and should be ready to hitchhike aboard launches of opportunity as early as 2016.  The next set of projects will soon begin their 2-year period of design, construction and testing, becoming ready for launch as early as 2018.   These projects are highly innovative proving that the technology exists to construct sought-after Earth-viewing space sensors in miniaturized form for a fraction of the cost.  For example, we have personal experience in developing HARP, an Earth-viewing multi-angle, multi-wavelength imaging polarimeter.  HARP is based on a concept called PACS that has been flown successfully on the NASA ER-2.  HARP, however, has been miniaturized to be roughly 1/10 of PACS’ volume and weight while keeping the same requirements.  The technology of miniaturization makes an Earth science micro-satellite program viable and timely.  The ESTO InVEST problem is termed ‘technology demonstration’.  The problem with the ESTO InVEST program is that it stops at the technology demonstration.  There is no mechanism for turning these measurements into science, including algorithm development and data dissemination. The current Venture Class program allows for some micro satellite component but it takes second sit on the larger size missions. We need a comprehensive Micro-Satellite program that calls for and support instrument and mission development from beginning to end.    We envision an Earth science micro satellite program in which there is programmatic support for an infrastructure of common mission operations, downlink and data processing.   Data would be public and archived in a common format with readers and tools made available to all users.  The individual satellites, sensors and missions would be awarded competitively.    NASA knows how to do this.  The Earth Venture sub-orbital program provides a template.  An Earth Venture micro-satellite program would similarly encourage 5-year courses of study that would include the building and launching of one or more micro satellites, and the time and resources to produce and make scientific use of the data.  3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/ questions?  Micro-satellites permit a view of the Earth unmatched by other existing or proposed platform.  Sub-orbital measurements are essential components of addressing the Big Questions stated above, but they do not provide a global perspective.  Micro-satellites provide a cost effective global picture and numerous possibilities for multi-platform and formations flying observations.  Unlike large flagship platforms or smaller Earth Venture missions, micro-satellites are conceived as components of a larger whole.  They may be CubeSats (e.g. space-worthy technology of particular size dimensions), CapSats (e.g. laboratory instruments in special containers), or something else not already defined.  They can fly in clusters or in formations, and can be launched sequentially to maintain a longer data record.  These instruments are not well-suited to maintain Climate Data Records, but they are perfect for process-oriented studies, obtaining the observations that focus on specific Earth science unknowns or controversies such as the effect of aerosols in invigorating deep convection.  Micro-satellite launches could be planned in conjunction with specific field experiments or Earth Venture Sub-orbital campaigns to add specific space-based support to the campaign.  The use of relatively inexpensive satellites allows for multiple instruments in differing orbits, and could be used to measure the global diurnal cycle of various phenomena. This becomes essential as GEO orbits become filled with high capability sensors that produce excellent temporal information for a limited region.  Micro satellites may become the glue that binds these regional data sets into a global whole.  In conclusion, we are proposing this solution to a key operational concern facing the future of a space-based Earth science, and that is how to maintain and expand EOS-level quality for future measurement-based science, at a price we can afford.

Sea surface air pressure measurements for reliable longer-term storm track and  intensification predictions      Hurricanes, such as Katrina and recent Super-storm Sandy, produce dangerous   winds, torrential rains and floods, all of which result in the loss of lives, tremendous  property damages and economic losses. It is estimated that hurricane Katrina and Sandy  resulted in 108 and 68 billion dollars in damages, respectively.  More accurate forecasts  of the track and intensity well ahead of the landfall of such powerful storms can better  pinpoint the time and location of landfall and corresponding strength of the storm.  This  not only diminishes public risk, but also reduces the economic loss of unnecessary  evacuations. Every mile of improved forecast accuracy would bring considerable savings  and public peace of mind. Therefore, improved weather forecasts, especially longer-term,  more reliable storm track and intensification predictions of hurricanes are extremely  important not only to earth sciences but also to public safety and national security.     The underlying processes that drive severe weather (e.g., hurricanes) are neither  fully understood nor adequately characterized in weather prediction models, so high  priority is placed on measurements that will contribute to successful forecasts of such  events.  As atmospheric pressure gradients are the primary driving force of atmospheric             motions that transport mass, moisture and momentum, numerical weather prediction  (NWP) models are critically dependent on accurate estimates of the pressure field.  Surface pressure observations makeup the backbone of modern weather forecasting.   Without the hundreds of surface observing stations across the US, the accuracy of the 5- 10 day forecast relied upon daily by the public and commerce would be considerably  compromised.  Unfortunately, the spatial coverage of surface observing stations on land  is not feasible over the ocean.  Pressure information is provided by buoys which for  economic and practical reasons are sparsely deployed across the ocean -- hundreds to  thousands of miles apart, especially away from shipping lanes or coasts. But this is  precisely where is needed to improve hurricane forecasts. Hence, the proper specification  and analysis of sea surface pressure are important prerequisites of accurate numerical  weather prediction (NWP) for improving tropical storm track and intensification  forecasting. Sea surface pressure measurements are pone of key challenges for Earth  System Science, particularly for reliable longer-term storm track and intensification  predictions, as discussed in the last Decadal Survey.     Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness? Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     The devastation of Katrina and Super-storm Sandy compels action to improve  public safety and reduce the risk of economic loss from hurricanes. Accurate, precise, all- weather, high-temporal-resolution, and high-spatial-resolution global profiles of pressure,  temperature, wind and water vapor are basic requirements of a sustained global observing  system to support the understanding and prediction of virtually all aspects of weather,  including such high-impact phenomena as hurricanes and heavy precipitation events.  However, scientific applications are severely limited by the lack of directly measured  those key meteorology fields over the oceans, the tropics, and the polar regions, where  meteorological observations are scarce. Space-based remote sensing instrumentation is  the only effective means in obtaining sufficient coverage of the vast oceans to improve  forecast accuracy.  Currently, satellites provide information on sea surface temperature  and to some extent sea surface winds.  But such information is not presently provided  on sea surface pressure, the most important key ingredient needed for accurate  forecasts.       To address this weakness in the current global forecast system, the development  of a new satellite radar system is needed and has been proposed to provide highly  accurate and spatially dense information on surface pressure over the ocean. As the total  extinction of radar echoes from surfaces at the 50~55 GHz O2 absorption band is strongly  correlated to atmospheric column O2 amounts, thus, atmospheric path lengths and surface  air pressures, the novel technique is to use the absorption difference from the echoes of a  dual-frequency O2-band radar to estimate the surface pressure. The two adjacent  frequencies are selected such that the microwave absorption effects of liquid water and  water vapor can be effectively removed from the ratio of reflected radar signals of the  two channels. A critical feature of this technology is that it can make observations from  space through thick clouds which is challenging for alternative technologies of sea     surface pressure.  Analyses show that the accuracy of surface air pressure from this  technology are comparable to conventional state-of-art buoy measurements, with the  advantage of being provided at much greater spatial density under all-weather  conditions across the ocean addresses the weakness in the global forecast system. The  proposed system is a novel concept for surface pressure barometry and can be developed  using existing commercial off the shelf technologies.  It is a high return in the potential  societal benefits but low risk in terms of the cost of development as compared to other  technologies. Currently a research team led by NASA Langley Research Center has  improved this differential absorption barometric radar (DiBAR) concept with limited  resources. A space DiBAR system design has been developed, a prototype DiBAR has  been built, and laboratory, ground and low altitude flight tests of the instrument have  been conducted, which leads to multiple peer-reviewed journal publications and an award  of US patent.  The DiBAR system assessment and flight test results both show that the  accuracy in surface pressure measurements is comparable to in-situ measurements and  thus, these measurements can be directly used in NWP models.       Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the  capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and  associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?     Although it is one of the most important atmospheric variables, surface air pressure is   currently only measured by limited numbers of in-situ observations conducted by buoys,  ships or dropsondes over oceans which are sparse in spatial coverage and expensive to  implement.  With developments of remote sensing methods, especially in airborne and  satellite remote sensing techniques, large scale and global surface pressure measurements  significantly lag those for other important variables, such as temperature and humidity.   There are potentials to use satellite oxygen A-band absorption characteristics (both  passive and active) to measure the surface pressure.  However, various difficulties in  oxygen A-band systems limit their accuracy and coverage: e.g., no accurate retrievals  under cloudy conditions (even optically thin clouds). There are no mature remote sensing  technologies that can directly measure the dynamic fields, especially for hurricanes.  The  3-D Wind Demo mission clearly shows this shortcoming: it is designed as the last DS  mission and only for technology demonstration.  Furthermore, Doppler wind lidars do not  meet the all-weather requirements, because they do not provide data in cloudy regions.  This radar system is a great complementary for wind lidars for 3-D wind observations  under all-weather conditions. With direct measurements of pressure fields, wind fields  can be estimated through dynamic calculations or NWP models. Therefore, a dual- frequency O2-band radar system will fill the observational gap in atmospheric dynamics  under all-weather conditions.    How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of  data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs;     Reliable global observations of winds are also needed to improve scientific  understanding of atmospheric dynamics, the transport of air pollution, and climate  processes, and to assess the dangerous wind impacts of hurricanes and severe storms.     Satellite sounders provide good global coverage of microwave and infrared radiances,  which can be assimilated directly for an accurate definition of temperature and humidity  profiles. When that information is coupled with surface pressure information, the wind  field can be estimated with the balance and adjustment of modeled dynamic fields in  numerical weather prediction models or approximately with geostrophic and hydrostatic  balance. Particularly, a dual-frequency O2-band radar system would extend the coverage  of vector winds into the rainy centers of hurricanes and storms and would provide the  vector winds needed for weather forecasts. Therefore, this radar system, along with other  sensors (e.g. wind lidar), will extend wind field measurements from clear skies to all- weather conditions and enhance the 3-D Wind Demo mission, especially for severe  storms.       While the ability to understand and predict hurricanes and other tropical cyclones   has improved, particularly with respect to storm tracking, much remains unknown  concerning, such as storm dynamics, rapid intensity change, and impact on extratropical  cyclones. Higher-spatial resolution observations of winds and sea level pressures under  all-weather conditions can be obtained and are needed to understand and predict the  effects of warm ocean regions on hurricane intensification, particularly combined with  satellite observed sea surface temperature and water vapor profiles.     The anticipated scientific and societal benefits     Despite the recent advances and sophistication of modern data-assimilation   methods, large analysis uncertainties remain over wide areas of the globe, especially for  the pressure field. Surface pressure is a key dynamic field and is the number-one unmet  measurement objective for improving weather forecasts. More accurate and reliable and  longer-lead-time weather forecasts, driven by fundamentally improved tropospheric  pressure and wind observations from space, would have directly measurable societal and  economic impacts. Improved forecasts of extreme-weather events would also benefit  public safety through disaster mitigation.     The science communities that would be involved     The science communities directly involved in the challenge of surface pressure  measurements for reliable longer-term storm track and intensification predictions  includes atmosphere and ocean communities.

Leroy, James G. Anderson  Harvard University    Description. The climate research community requires an objective and quantitative capability  to design climate observing systems and establish their requirements so as to maximize scientific  value in a cost-effective way. The tool should be a “climate OSSE” and should be based in  standard methods of Bayesian uncertainty quantification.     1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic   research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?    A key challenge for the Earth Science programs at NASA and NOAA is the development of an  objective and quantitative capability to design climate observing systems appropriate to testing  climate models according to their predictive capability1 and to assure their maximum economic  benefit. The challenge can be answered with a program in Climate Observation System  Simulation Experiments—“climate OSSEs” —an idea taken from the numerical weather  prediction community. In a weather prediction OSSE, simulated data of a prospective weather  instrument are assimilated into a weather prediction system to examine whether and to what  degree the data might improve prediction and what the requirements on the prospective  instrument should be. An OSSE is undertaken by most major weather prediction centers around  the world when considering new instrumentation. The same capability for designing and  evaluating observing systems can be developed for climate by the Earth Science programs of  NASA and NOAA.     Up to the present, climate observing programs have chosen space missions in large part based on  the intuitive judgment of the best experts available. Nonetheless, the subjective and qualitative  aspects of the decision making entail disputes in the climate community and the perception of  undue influence by parties with non-scientific interests in the outcome of the decision. Also,  requirements on mission architecture, spatial-temporal-spectral coverage, and on the accuracy  and precision are left to the judgment of committees and science teams. The result is a  community that regularly questions itself regarding the missions it selects and revises the  requirements of its selected missions. There is a clear need for an objective and quantitative  capability to help design missions and evaluate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness.      In a climate OSSE, a climate model (or ensemble of independent climate models) that can  simulate the data of a prospective mission and can generate the predictions declared as the  scientific goal of that mission are subjected to uncertainty quantification. The uncertainty  quantification must sample the generally acknowledged uncertain physics, chemistry, and  biology of the climate relevant to the scientific goals of the mission. The realizations of physics,  chemistry and biology that produce hind-casts that compare most favorably with actual data are                                                   1 Goody et al., Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 83, 873–878.       2   given more serious consideration in arriving at final scientific conclusions. Observation error  reduces the efficacy of the comparison of model hind-cast and data, and inappropriate coverage  can greatly inhibit the optimality of information needed to reduce uncertainty in the mission’s  scientific objective. A climate OSSE can analyze different configurations of instrumentation and  varying levels of observation error to quantify the impact of both on a final scientific conclusion  for the mission. The methods are based in Bayesian uncertainty quantification and have been  described in the peer-reviewed literature2. They allow for objective determinations of spatial- temporal-spectral coverage of observations, their required accuracy and precision, and to what  degree they may be redundant with other data. They can analyze the value of an observation for  traditional as well as non-traditional objectives, such as multi-decadal temperature change,  extreme weather, fresh water availability, the spread of disease, forced migration, and the overall  economic benefit to global human society.     Implementation of a climate OSSE can take many forms. A climate OSSE requires (1) a core  model ensemble that can represent all prior uncertainties in the climate relevant to a prospective  mission’s objective, (2) the ability to simulate data like that to be produced by a prospective  mission, and (3) the ability to produce predictions corresponding to the objective of a prospective  mission. All three can be implemented in varying degrees of complexity, meaning that anyone  from an individual researcher to a substantial institute can undertake a climate OSSE. While in  the end only a sophisticated effort undertaken by an institution can deliver the conclusive climate  OSSEs needed for overall mission evaluation, the parameters around such efforts have yet to be  determined. Such parameters are, for example, what model or ensemble of models should be  considered as the core, whether or not to simulate data in all of its detail or instead produce  trends and variability in atmospheric variables that can be retrieved from the data, and what new  models must be connected to the core model to generate predictions related to human impact  such as forced migration, spread of disease3, and economic value in general4.       2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?    The climate research community is already intuitively familiar with the idea of a climate OSSE  inasmuch as it has already undertaken to mine existing climate data to improve constraints on  equilibrium climate sensitivity5. Small efforts in perturbed physics ensembles of domestic  climate models have been completed6, so there already exists expertise in the research  community in Bayesian uncertainty quantification7.                                                       2 Rougier, Clim.

Sci., 108, 10405–10409, 2011  3 USGCRP Climate and Health Assessment, globalchange.gov/health-assessment, 2015.   4 Cooke et al., Environ. Syst. Decis., 34, 98–109, 2014.   5 Hall and Qu, Geophys.

Phys.: Conference Series, 180, doi:10.1088/1742-6596/180/1/012029.       3   Implementation of a climate OSSE will almost certainly take the form of both a small research  grant program and the development of an institute that will construct a large, sophisticated tool.  The former would be undertaken for the sake of exploratory studies on the potential value of new  observing systems; the latter would be undertaken for the sake of objective evaluation of  missions. Before initiation of a program of climate OSSEs, however, a formal discussion should  be held among representatives of modeling centers, scientists with expertise in perturbed physics  ensembles of climate models, interested investigators from existing climate observing missions,  and representatives of climate observing/monitoring programs of NASA and NOAA to develop a  plan for the outlines of a climate OSSE program.     Because a climate OSSE—like Bayesian uncertainty quantification—in general depends on the  completeness of the hypotheses to be tested and therefore awareness of all physical, chemical  and biological processes relevant to climate change, a climate OSSE cannot answer every  mission undertaken by the Earth science programs inasmuch as the community most certainly is  not aware of all processes relevant to climate change. For this very reason, there will always be a  need for missions of exploration, to obtain data at the frontiers of technological capability, so  that human awareness of those unknowns can be expanded and the newly identified processes  incorporated into climate models leading to a continually evolving program of climate OSSEs.        3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?    At present, Earth science programs are undertaking efforts at climate monitoring for the sake of  testing models according to their predictive capability. Climate models have not improved in  their ability to predict climate change since the Charney report8, and the uncertainties of the  climate system responsible remain largely unchanged. Because the unknowns in the physics,  chemistry and biology of climate are near universally acknowledged and still weakly  unconstrained, a program of climate OSSEs is ideally suited to the design and valuation of  climate monitoring systems. Considering that the Global Climate Observing System9 of WMO,  the NASA Decadal Survey mission CLARREO10, and other efforts worldwide are being  considered for climate monitoring for the sake of testing climate models, it is incumbent upon  the Earth science community to incorporate a program in climate OSSEs now.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in  the coming decade?     Open and coastal ocean ecosystems provide a wide range of socio-economic services to  humanity, including food, recreation, commerce, transportation and many others. These  systems modulate the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and other  elements that sustain life on Earth and stabilize climate. The grand challenge of our  time, in the face of the increasing impact of humans on the environment and  climate, is to derive actionable knowledge to ensure sustainable use of marine and  coastal resources and a healthy global society. This knowledge needs to be based on an  improved understanding of the complex interactions among physical, ecological,  biogeochemical and environmental oceanic processes. It requires frequent and repeated  observations to detect change in coastal and offshore aquatic environments at local to  global scales, attribute change to natural or anthropogenic causes, and develop tools to  evaluate, predict, inform and - as necessary - mitigate potential responses of ocean  ecosystems to future changes.    Key questions in Earth System Science are:     • How do the diversity and resilience of marine ecosystems change under present  and future environmental conditions?   Despite the importance of ocean ecosystems for society, our current understanding of the  processes that drive change in trophic interactions and community composition remains  poor. Changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment create stressors and  ecological regime shifts that may have lasting consequences to ecosystems and our own  well-being. To advance current understanding and improve model predictions, we need  observations under low sunlight and even polar night conditions, at the spatial and  temporal scales of bio-physical interactions in different habitats, including human uses,  from the surface to depths of several tens to hundreds of meters and at frequencies of tens  of minutes to diurnal scales. These observations are critical for securing ecological  balance and better resource use.     • How do boundary habitats differ from open ocean habitats and how do they  change?   Coasts and estuaries, the benthos, the interface between ice and water, and fronts between  water masses are examples of boundary habitats. They support some of the most  productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth that sustain important fisheries, industries,  human life and economy. However, our observing systems are not adequate to measure  the physical processes, biogeochemical transformations, and habitat changes at these     boundaries, or to understand how we can use the resources there in a sustainable way. To  address these issues and capture highly dynamic events across a range of environments,  we need repeated observations, with higher temporal and spatial resolution and signal to  noise ratio, at and below the ocean surface and in high-latitude areas.   • How is ocean biogeochemistry being modified by changes in elemental cycling  between ocean, land and atmospheric reservoirs?     The distributions of elements central to Earth’s climate and life, such as carbon, oxygen,  nitrogen, and others, are impacted by changes in marine biogeochemical cycles.  Processes such as marine photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, food web processes,  deposition of dust iron and other elements, carbon and nutrient runoff, tidal exchanges,  and ice-induced stratification are key to understanding the impacts of ocean processes on  carbon sequestration, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and how they are influenced by  short-term and climate-scale changes. We need higher spatial and temporal resolution,  global measurements, even below the ocean surface, and in polar regions to improve  prediction models and plan resource management strategies.     • How can we better prepare for, respond to, recover from, mitigate and adapt to  transient hazards and disasters?   Remote sensing observations of the oceans at appropriate temporal, spatial and spectral  resolution can be used to monitor extreme weather events, oil spills, harmful algal  blooms and resulting impacts such as flooding/ erosion of coastal communities and  associated floating debris and pollution. Science-based operational strategies to detect  events and impacts on biology, biodiversity, and water quality that are directly relevant to  our health and the resources we use, combined with the integration of those data in  models, can provide solutions for society to better prepare and respond to those transient  problems and disasters.     2. The opportunity     Over the past 50 years, the Earth Science community has gained a profound  understanding of global ocean ecosystems and biogeochemistry, and how they are  influenced by weather, climate, and human-driven change. The next planned mission,  PACE, will continue the high-quality record of visible reflectance of the global ocean and  will significantly advance capabilities with higher spectral resolution. Yet, the research  done with previous satellite missions and ocean sensors has also shown considerable  limitations. Current knowledge and technology can transform the observational  capabilities of future-ocean observing satellite missions. Repeated, high frequency  (~hourly), and high spatial resolution observations (~10-300m) would allow the study  of critical land-ocean-ice-atmosphere boundary habitats, and monitor for extreme events.  Space-based or suborbital observations using an active ocean profiling sensor would  resolve variability below the surface ocean and enable more accurate quantification of  plankton stocks and ocean productivity, and detailed evaluations of the interaction  between ocean physical processes and ecosystem structure.      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?       The ocean is a challenging environment for ground-based observations. Ship-based  studies are expensive and inherently limited in spatial and temporal scope.  Airborne  measurements of coastal processes can be useful, particularly for targeted regions, events  or processes.  Space-based observations, however, allow continuous monitoring of ocean  ecosystems over an annual cycle, provide a synoptic view of the entire ocean,  capture  large scale variability, and allow for detection of temporal trends and  differentiation in system functioning across regions and regimes. In addition, satellite  observations provide a crucial link in upscaling the detailed information obtained from  process-focused field studies to the coarser scale of climate model simulations. New  space-based and suborbital observations can revolutionize process parameterizations,  quantification of biogeochemical fluxes and stocks, and the study of complex interactions  such as between marine biology and fronts/eddies or marine biogenic aerosols and lower  atmosphere chemistry and clouds.     a. Do existing and planned U.S. and international programs provide the capabilities  necessary to make substantial progress ? If not, what additional investments are  needed?  Planned U.S. and international programs, such as PACE, will provide better  determination of phytoplankton functional groups and, potentially, taxa, but will not lead  to improvements in quantifying coastal habitats and the four dimensional dynamics of the  global ocean. The operational US sensor VIIRS as well as the Landsat and Sentinel-2  sensors lack the spectral and temporal resolution and signal to noise ratio necessary to  adequately measure changes in biogeochemistry and ecology in turbid coastal areas.  There is no planned concept that provides observations of critical primary producer  dynamics below the surface ocean.    b. What links are needed between space-based observations and other observations to  increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs?  Despite the advances in satellite oceanography, operational weather, fisheries and  conservation forecasting, agencies don’t routinely incorporate new remote sensing  biogeochemical observations into assimilation models. They often consider such  observations experimental and of insufficient temporal or spatial resolution.  Incorporating new discoveries and high-quality, science-based remote sensing  capabilities (space-based, airborne, underwater and autonomous sensor technologies) into  the nation’s operational infrastructure needs to include improved linkages between  science, policy and operations, renewed cooperative planning among U.S. agencies and  the international community.     c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits of new measurements  Past experience has shown that changes that could be observed by satellites have had  significant positive impacts on human health, sustenance, property, and the economy.  Pollution, sea level rise, sea-ice melt, land-use change, hazards, and disasters, alter the  biogeochemical nature and biodiversity of the marine and freshwater habitats and  wetlands with profound effects to local food webs and the quality of life. Our increasing  dependence on these resources should rely on sustainable and appropriate management.     Such management directly depends upon observations and a clear understanding of the  processes driving the change, the interactions with land, ice and atmosphere as well as the  outcome these changes may have. Such an improved understanding will allow for better  preparation, mitigation and potential recovery from transient, short-term and climate- level changes.    d. The science communities that would be involved  Designing the future observing systems for the next generation ocean science research  requires a more integrative approach to observations, one that combines physical and  biogeochemical measurements at different temporal and spatial scales. The physical  oceanography and the ocean ecology, biology and biogeochemistry (OBB) communities  would mutually benefit from combined missions.  In addition, careful integration of the  OBB  community with the terrestrial and the cryosphere communities should be  promoted, due to the importance of the exchanges across the boundaries. Lastly, the  oceans play a major role in the global carbon cycle and the carbon-climate feedbacks,  which are most naturally addressed in collaboration with terrestrial and atmospheric  carbon cycle scientists.    Taking these into account, the OBB community is prepared to assist and participate in  groups or panels addressing the carbon cycle, biogeochemistry and radiative forcing, and  in groups focused on terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

 and   Dynamics   Laboratory    NASA   Goddard   Space   Flight   Center,   Greenbelt,   Maryland           Quantifying   the   anticipated   response   of   the   stratospheric   ozone   layer   to    anthropogenic   changes   in   composition   in   the   21st   century   constitutes   a   key    challenge   for   Earth   System   Science.         Photochemical   and   radiative   processes   affecting   the   stratospheric   ozone   layer   couple   the   troposphere   and   stratosphere.      The   ozone   layer   absorbs   ultraviolet   (UV)   radiation,   protecting   life   on   Earth   by   controlling   how   much   UV   radiation   reaches   the   surface.      Stratospheric   ozone   is   produced   by   photolysis   of   oxygen   molecules   and   destroyed   chemically   by   catalytic   processes   involving   trace   gases   containing   nitrogen,   hydrogen,   and   halogen   (chlorine   and   bromine)   atoms.   The   stratospheric   circulation   controls   many   aspects   of   the   total   ozone   distribution.   Dynamic   and   photochemical   processes   both   influence   and   are   influenced   by   ozone   layer   evolution.   Ozone   heating   affects   the   stratospheric   circulation   and   ozone   itself   is   a   greenhouse   gas   (GHG)   in   the   lower   stratosphere   and   upper   troposphere.   Ozone   evolution   in   the   next   century   depends   on   both   decreases   in   ozone   depleting   substances   (ODSs)   and   GHG   increases   that   alter   stratospheric   temperature   and   circulation.   Halogen-­‐containing   compounds   increased   by   more   than   a   factor   of   four   between   1965   and   2000,   causing   a   decrease   in   global   stratospheric   ozone   and   severe   ozone   depletion   at   high   latitudes   (e.g.,   the   Antarctic   ozone   hole   (AOH)).   The   AOH   leads   to   high   springtime   surface   UV   and   also   forced   trends   in   southern   hemisphere   tropospheric   climate.      The   1987   Montreal   Protocol   (MP)   and   its   amendments   regulate   production   of   ODSs   (chlorofluorocarbons   and   halons).   Although   ODS   levels   have   been   declining   since   the   1990s   due   to   the   MP,   their   atmospheric   lifetimes   are   long   (decades   to   centuries),   and   the   current   rate   of   ODS   decrease   is   much   smaller   than   its   prior   rate   of   increase.      The   main   GHGs   (carbon   dioxide   (CO2),   methane   (CH4),   and   nitrous   oxide   (N2O))   continue   to   increase.   ODSs   and   their   replacement   compounds   are   also   powerful   GHGs;   changes   in   GHGs   alter   stratospheric   circulation   and   climate.   Simulations   show   increased   lifting   in   the   tropical   lower   stratosphere   that   decreases   the   tropical   ozone   layer   and   alters   distributions   of   ODSs   and   other   GHGs.   CO2   increases   also   cool   the   middle   and   upper   stratosphere,   slowing   temperature   dependent   catalytic   loss   cycles   and   increasing   upper   stratospheric   ozone.       This   challenge   is   timely.   In   models,   the   importance   of   ODS   decrease   relative   to   GHG   increase   will   change   in   the   2020   –   2030   timeframe.      Observations   are   necessary   to   expand   our   knowledge   of   the   climate-­‐stratospheric   composition   system   and   test   the   adequacy   and   reliability   of   models   used   to   project   future   ozone   levels.       The   expected   ozone   increase   due   to   ODS   decrease   is   difficult   to   isolate   in   a   backdrop   of   natural   variability   and   GHG   forced   changes   in   circulation   and   climate.   Although   models   agree   that   the   mass   entering   the   stratosphere   will   continue   to   increase,   there   is   no   consensus   as   to   the   vertical   extent   of   the   tropical   circulation   increase   or   the   latitudinal   distribution   of   increased   downwelling.      Consequently,   future   evolution   of   lower   stratospheric   midlatitude   ozone   is   in   question.   Chemical   and   dynamical   processes   in   the   lower   stratosphere   will   contribute   to   the   change   in   total   ozone   column   at   midlatitudes,   thus   composition   measurements   are   to   quantify   an   ozone   increase   due   to   ODS   decline   apart   from   the   influence   of   changes   in   circulation   and   climate.      Such   attribution   is   necessary   to   demonstrate   the   benefit   of   the   MP.         The   evolution   of   aerosols   and   stratospheric   water   vapor   contribute   to   uncertainty   in   prediction   of   the   stratospheric   ozone   and   climate   change.         Stratospheric   water   vapor,   a   source   of   hydrogen   radicals   and   an   important   GHG,   increases   as   the   tropical   tropopause   temperature   increases   (and   vice   versa).      Increasing   or   decreasing   water   in   the   lower   and   lowermost   stratosphere   amplifies   or   opposes   the   impact   of   other   GHGs   increases   through   radiative   processes.   Stratospheric   aerosols   affect   surface   temperature,   cirrus   cloud   formation   in   the   upper   troposphere/lower   stratosphere,   stratospheric   dynamics   and   ozone   loss   processes   (through   heterogeneous   chemical   reactions   on   the   particle   surfaces).    Global   measurements   are   necessary.   Global   measurements   of   ozone,   temperature,   H2O,   and   related   constituents   are   necessary   to   reduce   uncertainty   in   projections   of   future   ozone   levels.   The   natural   variability   of   the   system   must   be   quantified   to   identify   signatures   of   anthropogenic   change.      Attribution   of   an   ozone   increase   due   to   ODS   decrease   is   necessary   information   for   the   parties   to   the   MP.   The   midlatitude   column   ozone   increase   due   to   climate   and   circulation   change,   projected   by   the   end   of   the   century,   is   substantial   and   would   decrease   the   amount   of   UV   radiation   reaching   the   surface   compared   with   historical   levels.   Continuing   observations   are   necessary   to   quantify   the   evolution   of   stratospheric   aerosols   as   well   as   their   impact   on   the   ozone   layer   and   the   Earth   radiation   balance.   Aerosol   observations   and   analysis   are   at   the   foundation   of   proposed   efforts   to   mitigate   climate   change   through   geo-­‐engineering.    Existing   and   planned   US   and   international   programs   Previous   and   ongoing   satellite   missions   have   established   sound   observational   techniques   and   have   yielded   important   results:     • The   Microwave   Limb   Sounder   (MLS)   and   Ozone   Monitoring   Instrument,   both   on   NASA’s   Aura   satellite,   provide   global   measurements   of   total   column   ozone   and   ozone   profiles.   MLS   measurements   of   H2O,   hydrogen   chloride   (HCl),   chlorine   monoxide   (ClO),   and   N2O   can   be   used   to   quantify   dynamic   and   photochemical   changes   in   ozone.   Aura   was   launched   in   2004   and   is   five   years   past   design   lifetime.          • The   Atmospheric   Chemistry   Experiment   (ACE)   a   Fourier   transform   infrared   spectrometer   on   the   Canadian   SciSat   (launched   in   2003),   provides   profiles   of   many   constituents   through   solar   occultation.             • Global   total   ozone   and   ozone   profiles   will   continue   from   the   Ozone   Mapping   Profiler   Suite   (OMPS)   on   Suomi   NPP   and   the   Joint   Polar   Satellite   System   (JPSS-­‐1)   to   be   launched   in   2017.   Attribution   of   ozone   change   to   chlorine   change   or   quantifying   the   ozone   change   due   to   climate   change   is   not   possible   without   additional   measurements.      Stratospheric   aerosols   are   obtained   from   Suomi   NPP   and   will   be   obtained   from   JPSS-­‐2   (expected   launch   2022)   but   not   JPSS-­‐1.    • The   Stratospheric   Aerosol   and   Gas   Experiment   III   (SAGE   III)   will   measure   profiles   of   aerosols,   ozone,   temperature,   nitrogen   dioxide   (NO2)   and   H2O   from   the   upper   troposphere   through   the   stratosphere   from   the   International   Space   Station   (ISS),   approximately   2016   –   2020.      There   are   no   planned   missions   that   would   include   measurements   of   trace   gases   other   than   ozone   and   water   vapor   during   the   time   period   when   the   balance   of   processes   controlling   ozone   evolution   is   most   uncertain   (2020   –   2035).   Existing   technology,   however,   places   the   community   in   a   good   position   for   follow-­‐on   missions.      An   ACE-­‐type   instrument   deployed   on   the   ISS   (proposed   to   the   EV   program   by   APEX)   or   timely   deployment   of   a   version   of   an   Aura   instrument   (e.g.,   MLS   or   an   infrared   limb   sounder)   would   provide   the   needed   measurements.         Details   of   suggested   space-­‐based,   suborbital   and   ground-­‐based   measurements   are   given   in   Table   1.     Linking   space-­‐based   and   ground   based   observations   Ground   based   observations   play   an   important   role.      NOAA   and   AGAGE   networks   measurements   of   all   of   the   major   ODSs   underlie   predictions   of   emissions   and   the   evolution   of   these   source   gases   to   the   22nd   century.      NDACC   provides   column   measurements   of   key   stratospheric   gases.      The   multi-­‐decadal   NDACC   timeseries   complement   existing   datasets   and   continued   measurements   will   ensure   the   success   of   future   deployments   of   space-­‐based   instruments.          Scientific   and   societal   benefits      Monitoring   stratospheric   ozone,   and   constituents   such   as   HCl   and   N2O   necessary   to   quantify   the   ozone   responses   to   ODS   decline   and   to   changes   in   circulation   and   climate   due   to   GHG   growth,   is   beneficial   to   society   because   stratospheric   ozone   controls   the   amount   of   UV   light   reaching   the   Earth’s   surface,   thereby   protecting   life.      Such   observations   are   key   to   fulfilling   responsibilities   to   the   US   Congress   and   to   the   Vienna   Convention   and   the   Montreal   Protocol.                          Table 1.

Key challenges/questions identified by approximately 53 respondents not-associated with a particular   geographic region are presented below (not listed in order of priority). Responses are presented   verbatim, with minor editing to improve understanding and combine similar comments.   Data Accessibility, Dissemination, and Challenges   1. How to create or improve data infrastructures using cloud-based computing   2. How to improve resolution   3. What's NASA's contribution to the big data challenge and opportunities?   4. How can we improve the latency of new missions?   5. How can we enhance data interoperability across sensors and platforms?   6. How can we make data access easier, including products accessed through a Distributed Active   Archive Center (DAAC)?   7. How can we improve partnerships with other agencies?   8. Near-real-time (NRT) all-weather surveillance of the land surface without cloud cover   obscuration   9. Synergy of remotely sensed signals (e.g., reflectance, thermal, LIDAR, microwave)   10. Can Landsat be funded to avoid data gaps?   Integration with End Users   11. How best to involve local communities in NASA-funded application projects to provide   actionable information needed on the ground?   12.

What are the primary sources of seasonal climate predictability and how does predictability   change with time?   17. Which mitigation efforts impact climate change in positive ways?   18. How much can we improve weather and climate simulation (on subseasonal to interannual   scales) through higher spatial resolution observations and simulations?   19. What are the full impacts of dust on local and regional precipitation, and can we simulate   coupled hydrological-dust dynamics realistically at regional scale?   20. How is climate change affecting site-level weather variables (e.g., precipitation) both spatially   and temporally?              Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – General  Issues  2   Q.2 Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Respondents were not asked to comment on the timeliness of proposed key questions/challenges.   Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new ones, and facilitating the use of satellite data.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Aquarius – Helpful in El Niño prediction    CloudSat – Relevant to climate, weather    DEMs – Topography mission such as the proposed LIST to provide much needed better vertical   DEMs for building stronger resilience.    GCOM-W1    GEOS (All) – Relevant to climate, weather    GPM – Relevant to precipitation, weather, climate, etc.    Ensuring GRACE-FO and GRACE2 is critical for climate    Landsat – Number 1 priority would be to ensure the continuity of Landsat.   o The world relies on Landsat for the bulk of Earth observations including mapping and   monitoring.   o Critically important for understanding change through time.    MODIS – A ‘must-have’    Near-surface humidity and air temperature – Important weather drivers    OCO – Important for measuring atmospheric CO2 given climate change    Radar    Suomi-NPP, Terra, Aqua (workhorses of NASA) – Support an extremely wide range of   applications    SMAP and other soil moisture at high resolution and high accuracy – Critical variable for health,   weather, etc.    SWOT – Relevant to global water cycle, climate, etc.    Thermal missions, moderate to high-resolution – Important for climate monitoring    The TRMM/GPM legacy is critical for all manner of applications areas and needs to be   continued.    Tropospheric chemistry species such as MOPITT, TES, MLS, AIRS – Relevant to human health,   energy and climate    Visible, near-infrared and thermal    The 30-odd Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) are key to continue measuring.    Articulating the value of NASA Earth Science supported research to end users and the general   public, and/or enabling them to discover the value of this research for themselves, should   remain a top priority.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – General  Issues  3   Suggestions for additional investments include:    Data Accessibility, Dissemination, and Challenges    An archiving data system or open cloud computing service that provides easy access to data and   imagery.    Emphasize continuity. It is critical that capabilities of sensors for the last 20-30 years be   maintained on future sensors to ensure continuity of data records.    Improved NRT access to data products to support disaster response, science and application   needs:   o Use infrastructures similar to LANCE and Worldview.   o NRT information measured against averages or baselines to identify/predict trends can   support operational decisions and influence major strategy and policy decisions.   o Most A-train sensors have provided NRT capability which end user communities have   been able to use to study their thematic interests. The availability of NRT satellite sensor   datasets has often provided results not necessarily intended by the original sensor   design.   o Continue direct broadcast capabilities on future instruments, and/or design/optimize   data streams to support availability of key science data products to end users with very   low latency.    4-16 pt sq/m NIR or green LIDAR satellite; high density p-band ifsar satellite; constellation of   20cm-5m 8-16 band (b-TIR) satellites.    Latency and format of user friendly products are key to their infusion into decision-making and   use in chemical and meteorological models.     Geospatial metadata that enables the use of ArcGIS products to readily fit into application tools   without a lot of reformatting and re-projection work on the user's dime.    Software infrastructure similar to Google Earth Engine that allows for more rapid processing of   satellite products without the need to transfer large quantities of data.     Hyperspectral with thermal because the number of resultant data products would enable broad   science advancement across numerous areas.    Build and launch additional MODIS sensors   o Beyond what VIIRS is currently providing    o With higher resolution on thermal sensor    o Include two sensors flying simultaneously in a morning/afternoon orbit like Terra and   Aqua do now.   o Critical to maintain the long-term continuity of the calibrated MODIS record   o The MODIS suite of sensors has provided one of the most complete sets of value-added   products for the entire remote sensing community.    Fine-resolution images without cloud cover or little cloud cover, which renders some images   useless, especially images taken close to the ocean and during wet seasons.    High temporal and spatial resolution land products – to examine changes in Earth’s surface,   from vegetation to fires. This can be used as input to weather/climate, air quality, emissions   models; and for land development and management actions.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – General  Issues  4    To obtain near-continuous (daily) monitoring of the water and energy balance globally, it is   essential that a satellite system be implemented that has a sensor package spanning the visible   to microwave wavelengths.     o Critical to many applications in climate and weather forecasting.    For research applications, a satellite with very high resolution would be very beneficial. Many   research plots are much smaller than currently available resolution, which limits possibilities of   research projects using remote sensing.    A data fusion product at 20 to 30 m spatial resolution with bands similar to Landsat but   augmented spectrally. Most importantly, have FREQUENT overpasses so that the product   reliably has value in a 5-day composite period.    Currently it appears that the geostationary ABI (or ABI like) sensors are the future direction for   most of the remote sensing community. Much of the scientific and applied research   communities will be applying their resources to the channels, temporal scale, and effective field   of view of these sensors.    Build and launch additional Landsat sensors   o Have multiple Landsat sensors flying at one time in order to provide temporal resolution   of ~4 days.   o Possibly two sensors up at the same time for both redundancy and more frequent   collections.    o Additional thermal bands.     Climate Change    Tools to improve cities’ resilience    High-resolution spatial (km) and temporal measurements (hourly) to determine regional levels   of CH4 from natural and anthropogenic sources (e.g., fracking) to inform policy. CH4 emissions   can have an impact within a 20-year timeframe that is even greater than that of CO2.   Weather / Atmosphere    Vertically resolved, hourly observations of the chemical and meteorological characteristics of   the atmosphere, with the ability to track diurnal/weekly/monthly variation and trends across   North America.    Geostationary hyperspectral sounding capability to advance our ability to predict weather   events on short time scales.    Ozone measurements in the troposphere.    Real-time accurate precipitation measurement of fine resolution, especially over Africa.    Microwave temperature and humidity sounder instrument capable of resolving variability in the   lowest 1 km of atmosphere over the ocean.    Satellite-informed model of high-resolution intra-urban air temperature (and other near-surface   fields) – important for better representation of environmental conditions relevant to human   energy budget.     Reliable profiles of temperature, humidity, and other variables in the lower troposphere would   be extremely useful, contributing to studies of land-atmosphere interactions, evaluation of   climate models, and novel data assimilation techniques.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – General  Issues  5    Air temperature and humidity profiles in the lowest 1 km planetary boundary layer (PBL)   o PBL is a critical component of the atmosphere that is not well observed.    o Important to countless applications, from modeling of atmospheric convection to   atmospheric chemistry and Earth's energy and water cycles. For example,   evapotranspiration over land is dependent on turbulence within the PBL.      To increase the value of data and enable end users to fully understand satellite data and how it can be   used, it would be useful to provide:    Metadata (geographic scope, time series length)    Information on the uncertainty of satellite data    Data latency    GIS-ready imagery (orthorectified)    Models – Much data is available, but many people lack knowledge of how to turn data into   information.

Key challenges/questions identified by respondents not-associated with a particular geographic region   are presented below (not listed in order of priority).

Strategic implementation options for extremes   6. Accuracy of evaporation, transpiration, and evapotranspiration (ET) models using mass/volume   balance instead of indirect micrometeorological methods   7. How can we monitor more efficiently (less uncertainty) regional water budgets?   8. How well do existing water resources support demand, and how do limitations and constraints   vary geographically?   9. Can we close the remotely sensed water balance in mountainous basins? At present, systematic   problems in both rainfall and ET estimates make this difficult.   10. Where are the greatest changes in groundwater and soil moisture, and at what rate are these   changing? Are these trends expected to continue?   Agriculture / Food Security   11. Rangeland condition   12. Natural resource limitations on food   13. Tradeoffs between food and energy and the use of water to produce these   14. Can the new agriculture be sustainable?    15. How are changes in agricultural production impacting water resources at watershed and   regional scales?   16. How is climate change influencing agricultural management practices, particularly in irrigated   agriculture, which consumes 70-80% of the world’s freshwater (both surface and groundwater)?   17. Can spatial and temporal resolution be increased to enable effective decision-making for   agriculture?   18. How to improve or create spectral libraries of the main types of crops, either annual or fruit-  bearing.   19. How is agricultural production impacted by extreme weather events and the associated   vulnerabilities?   20. What satellite constellation is needed to provide early detection of significant crop failure due to   drought for early famine warning, particularly in third-world countries with no or very limited   ground information on crop condition or weather data?     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Water-Ag Food  Themes  2   Q.2 Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Respondents were not asked to comment on the timeliness of proposed key questions/challenges.   Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new ones.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Landsat – Number 1 priority would be to ensure the continuity of Landsat.   o The world now relies on Landsat for the bulk of Earth observations.   o ET maps derived from Landsat data have potential to be used in decision-making   regarding water resources management such as irrigation scheduling and regional water   planning, which require ET estimates over an individual field or entire region.   o ET estimates are critical for managing water resources and agriculture.    CloudSat     GCOM-W1    GEOS (All)     GPM     GRACE-FO and GRACE2   o The GRACE mission has revolutionized our understanding (and society's appreciation) of   trends in water storage across the planet.    MODIS, VIIRS, Landsat 8 and 9     Precipitation, groundwater – important for water resources    SMAP and other soil moisture at high resolution and high accuracy     Suomi-NPP, Terra, Aqua    SWOT     To reliably monitor/assess water resources, climate change impacts, agriculture production and   ecosystem health, satellites are needed to provide estimates of radiation, land use, vegetation   biomass/cover and structure, land surface temperature and vegetation phenology   o Provides a means to determine the energy, water, and carbon fluxes    o Resolutions required vary from field to regional scales depending on whether the   question being addressed relates to agriculture, hydrology, weather or climate.    AMSR-E, AMSR-2, GPM 37 GHz microwave emission data over land surface, globally –  exceptionally valuable for river discharge measurements and monitoring (the longer the period   of record, the more valuable current information is). Applications include immediate assessment   of flood magnitude/recurrence intervals, as events are underway.    Continue the distribution of multispectral images and/or finished products relevant to   agriculture, since it would enable in the near future the practice of precision farming of annual   crops and fruit trees by providing improvements in field productivity and ensuring the     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Water-Ag Food  Themes  3   traceability of agricultural production, thereby saving water and supplies and ultimately   improving returns by obtaining better sale prices.      Critical components of the Earth's energy and water cycles, which are also critical to providing   initial and boundary conditions (including radiative and turbulent heat fluxes) to coupled GCMs:   o sea surface temperature   o ocean surface wind vectors   o vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature   o vertical profiles of atmospheric humidity   o top of atmosphere shortwave and longwave radiation   o cloud properties (fraction, temperature/height, thickness)    Any and all data/observations which provide valuable soils, atmospheric, vegetation, climatic,   geologic, hydrologic, etc. information that can help decision-makers face the environmental and   social challenges ahead.   Suggestions for additional investments include:    Water Resources     Systematic water level databases and flooded area such as provided already somewhat by   MODIS and potentially by SWOT. However, these data need to be provided systematically and   not on a `research base` as has been more traditionally the case.    SWOT for surface water    GRACE-FO for groundwater    Water resources management would benefit most from a satellite with moderate resolution   (100 m or less) and daily acquisition frequency. The biggest hurdle for producer-level remote   sensing use is having good resolution data, including thermal, on a daily basis.    Higher spatial/time resolution groundwater observations (e.g., weekly at 100 km).    Microwave-domain river monitoring is proceeding at just several institutions but is proving   useful in operational settings (e.g., for assimilation into flood forecasting models). The 37 GHz   channel is nearly ideal for water/land discrimination, but was designed mainly to provide   background upwelling microwave signal for use in precipitation, other atmospheric variable   retrieval. A very useful satellite would optimize such microwave information for land/water   discrimination, and perhaps as coupled with a low-resolution SAR imager. Overall, something   like SMAP, but designed for surface water, not soil moisture, would extend and complement the   SWOT mission, and could use the same river mask for data acquisition.    To obtain daily water use/evapotranspiration monitoring of natural and agro-ecosystems at the   scale to resolve individual fields and fragmented ecosystems, NASA needs to build future   satellites to support water resources management by maintaining or improving the present   Landsat-standards of 30 x 30 meter pixel size ifr the visible and short-wave infrared bands, and   must have thermal infrared pixels no larger than 120 x 120 meters.     Consider launching a thermal free-flying satellite having at least the standards of the Landsat 8   thermal infrared sensor, placed in orbit in close proximity to the present and future European   Sentinel 2-type satellites, which do not have thermal-sensing capabilities.    o As a backup for potential failure of and as mitigation for the TIRS thermal imager on-  board Landsat 8, should it fail prior to the short-wave OLI sensor of the satellite.       Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Water-Ag Food  Themes  4    At watershed and regional scales, a satellite having visible, near-infrared, thermal and   microwave (K-band) sensors would provide near-continuous monitoring of water, energy and   carbon cycles critical for assessing climate change impacts on ecosystem health and water   resources.      Evapotranspiration observing strategy and a supporting observational system (global)    Soil moisture – higher frequency, daily    Water cycle extremes – Monitoring, early detection    Essential water cycle variables   o PRIMARY: precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow cover (& depth, freeze/thaw   margins), soil moisture, soil temperature, groundwater, runoff/streamflow/river   discharge, lake/reservoir levels and terrestrial water storage, water quality (nitrates,   phosphates, dissolved oxygen, algal blooms), water use/demand   o SUPPLEMENTARY: surface meteorology, surface and atmospheric radiation budget,   clouds, land cover, vegetation and land cover, land use, permafrost,   elevation/topography, geological stratification, surface altimetry, aerosols   Agriculture / Food Security    A high-resolution thermal sensor with at least 4 satellite passes per day and global cover, which   can be used to monitor water consumption for water crisis and food security.    An evaporation, transpiration, and evapotranspiration product with specifications: US coverage,   1 m spatial resolution, daily repeat frequency, +/- 0.5 mm accuracy and precision. To provide   real-time feedback for on-farm irrigation management and stream flow prediction in   mountainous regions that feed irrigated valleys below. This is urgently needed to improve crop   water productivity, which is central to addressing food-water-energy security.    Incorporate multispectral sensors for high temporal, spatial and radiometric resolution data,   primarily to address issues more specifically, e.g., scales of 1:5 or less, a pixel size of 1 m, and a   frequency of a few days.    Improve monitoring in mountain areas to continuously evaluate the volume of snow fall,   accumulated as a reserve of water in watersheds in the spring, and thus be able to better plan   the agricultural year.    o Improved multispectral data, spatial and temporal resolution, and quality of data to   better understand the availability of snow fall, especially in arid and semiarid areas, will   improve predictive models related to water availability, resulting in social and economic   benefits by increasing crop production.    Add spectral bands for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) to allow regional collection of crop   residue data.   o Regional mapping of crop residue helps reduce soil erosion.   o CAI = 100[0.5(R2.0 + R2.2) - R2.1] where R2.0, R2.1, and R2.2 are the reflectance values   in 10-nm bands centered at 2031, 2101, and 2211 nm, respectively.    Find ways to add other vegetation and water-sensitive sensors to Landsat missions, such as L-  band – important for food-water-energy security.

Considering the extended time horizon of the Decadal Survey (2017-2027), timeliness of proposed key   questions/challenges was not considered a critical factor.   Q.3 Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   To address proposed key challenges/questions, respondents offered several suggestions for continuing   existing satellite observations or implementing new ones.   Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    ICESaT-2 – relevant to ice, glaciers, Arctic, Antarctic    Landsat – Number 1 priority would be to ensure the continuity of Landsat.   o The world now relies on Landsat for the bulk of Earth observations including mapping   and monitoring.   o Relevant to Earth resources management, land use/land cover change, climate impacts,   invasive species, etc.    o Critically important for understanding change through time.    Suomi-NPP, Terra, Aqua (workhorses of NASA)   o Support a wide range of applications: climate, urban development, energy, catastrophic   event decision-making, etc.    The NASA A-train is proving to be one of the best satellite platforms for scientific and applied   research communities. The use of multiple sensors so close together in temporal space has   proven to be a distinct advantage for ocean, land, and atmospheric measurements, which can   be applied together to provide a more complete picture than any one sensor can provide.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Land-Ocean  Themes  3    High temporal, moderate resolution (<=250 meters) multi-spectral observations of the globe   (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS) to support land, atmosphere and ocean science applications and   information needs.    Forest health – Satellite observations and derived products that improve capabilities to detect   forest disturbance earlier (pests and pathogens) and monitor.    MODIS, VIIRS, Landsat 8 and 9 for land use    GEDI LIDAR for vegetation structure    Land cover type delineation such as vegetation and urban growth     Change monitoring for climate, deforestation and afforestation efforts    Fluorescence – key insight into plant productivity    NDVI – long-term record of plant greenness    Net radiation – key energy driver for ecosystem processes    The growing list of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) are key to continue measuring.    Any and all data/observations which provide valuable soils, oceanographic, vegetation, climatic,   geologic, etc. information that can help decision-makers face the environmental and social   challenges ahead.   Suggestions for additional investments include:    Biodiversity / Ecosystems / Forests    The primary need is for a combined imaging spectrometer (ranging from the UV/VIS edge into   the thermal infrared) and waveform LIDAR (operating in the green and near infrared   wavelengths) system. Such a system would allow us to capture ecosystem composition,   structure, and function simultaneously and thoroughly.    Build and launch additional Landsat sensors. Useful datasets would be    o Time series-derived products at the 30-m scale, including greenup/phenology   o Refined forest change maps   o Updateable map of land use and ownership   o Publicly available portal of such products across the globe.    LIDAR collection twice a year for leaf-on and leaf-off from satellite. LIDAR is needed for road,   tree, and building structural change after a large event.    High-resolution LIDAR missions would be beneficial for looking at forest and forest structure   components useful for carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, forest inventories.    A satellite-based imaging spectrometer similar to the capabilities provided from AVIRIS, in an   orbit which regularly covers CONUS, similar to Landsat   o Useful for species classification, plant health monitoring, and subpixel change detection,   which Landsat cannot currently match.    Soil moisture data would help when working with invasive species like cheatgrass. Comparing   moisture in different environments helps researchers understand plant reactions and ecosystem   development.    Hyperspectral – critical for understanding biodiversity and biodiversity loss     Fine-scale hyperspectral would help minimize confusion between like spectral signatures and   potentially lead to a more accurate and precise understanding of local, regional, and global   patterns.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Land-Ocean  Themes  4    A spectral signature library for plant species would help large land cover analysis and   identification of pre-fire species for land restoration decisions and large-scale land conservation   efforts.    Greater repeat cycles of high-resolution multispectral information required to compute   ecosystem indicators.    Change detection at a micro level is important for understanding local ecological impacts.      Fluorescence – key insight into plant productivity    An online tool (or dataset) for ecosystem risk assessments that enables monitoring of historical   loss or gain in the geographic distribution and parameters of function for any ecosystem type   (classification down to macrogroup level) and includes a level of present risk to future loss or   gain.    Modeled products for ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and   primary production for ecological forecasting.      To obtain near-continuous (daily) monitoring of the water and energy balance globally, it is   essential that a satellite system be implemented that has a sensor package spanning the visible   to microwave wavelengths.     o Provides observations necessary for all-weather capabilities at the watershed and   regional scales for global water, energy and carbon budget modeling and monitoring.     Target Earth observations to the most rapidly changing human (inhabited environments) and   the resources which support them – the effects of rapid urbanization, i.e., which cities are   growing fastest and what that means for the surrounding ecology.      Land Surface    Tools to improve urban areas planning to avoid overlapping of property rights.    Land use/land cover dynamics or change monitoring, at a reasonable frequency and spatial   resolution, including magnitude of change and source of change.    Relatively low spatial resolution (~100-200 m) global coverage frequent repeat c-band or l-band   SAR (synthetic aperture radar) land surface imager.    A LIDAR topography mission (LIDAR Surface Topography) should be a high-priority mission (e.g.,   LIST) since the current freely and globally available SRTM topography data is 15 years old and   hardly meets the accuracy requirements in the vertical for many applications. However, a LIDAR-  based mission such as LIST would certainly improve the current situation for NASA in terms of   topographic data needs.      Higher-resolution infrared imagery – to see structures buried below ground level (archaeological   sites)    A 'public good' fine-resolution optical sensor to support NASA's science needs, preferably with   simultaneous observation with a moderate-resolution sensor – to develop the next generation   multi-scale sampling product suite and provide a validation mechanism for moderate-resolution   products – relevant to Agriculture / Land Use / Carbon Monitoring.   Oceans    Bathymetry data accurate to 3 arc-seconds, worldwide oceans      Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Land-Ocean  Themes  5    Climate models show significant biases in their ability to represent planetary boundary layer   variability over the oceans, particularly in the tropics. This limits the model’s ability to resolve   convection and surface heat fluxes that are important to coupling of the atmosphere and ocean   across diurnal to seasonal and longer time scales. Improving seasonal climate forecasting is   challenging and will require accurate modeling of the upper ocean mixed layer on seasonal time   scales; thus improvements in seasonal forecasts may be directly tied to our ability to capture the   proper variability of surface fluxes.     Ocean evaporation remains the largest component of uncertainty in the global water cycle.    o Need ocean evaporation estimates from space, as ship and buoy measurements are too   sparse for realistic climate applications.    o Estimating evaporation from space is doable, but current space-based estimates are   primarily limited by errors in near-surface estimates of air temperature and humidity, a   direct result of the lack of satellite instrumentation designed for sub-boundary layer   temperature and humidity profile retrievals.   o Latent heat flux from ocean evaporation represents a substantial energy flux at the   Earth's surface – critical for both ocean and atmospheric energetics.

Existing observations that should be continued to support decision-making or application development   include:    Landsat – Number 1 priority would be to ensure the continuity of Landsat.   o The world now relies on Landsat for the bulk of Earth observations including mapping   and monitoring.   o Critically important for understanding change through time.    MODIS   o A ‘must-have’   o To maintain fire detection and mapping capabilities   o To help our understanding of emissions into the atmosphere on a large scale (gas and   aerosol) and their impact on human health.    Suomi-NPP, Terra, Aqua (workhorses of NASA)   o Support an extremely wide range of applications: climate, forest fires, energy,   catastrophic event decision-making, etc.    OCO – important for measuring atmospheric CO2 given climate change    SMAP and other soil moisture at high resolution and high accuracy – a critical variable for   health, weather, soils, and fire.   o As the climate changes and wildfires grow, soils need to be better understood.    The NASA A-train is proving to be one of the best satellite platforms for scientific and applied   research communities. The use of multiple sensors so close together in temporal space has   proven to be a distinct advantage for ocean, land, and atmospheric measurements, which can   be applied together to provide a more complete picture than any one sensor can provide.    High temporal, moderate resolution (<=250 meters) multi-spectral observations of the globe   (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS) to support land, atmosphere and ocean science applications and   information needs.    High temporal thermal observations (multiple times daily) at moderate to high resolution to   support active fire detection, monitoring and characterization.    Fire-related variables – thermal anomalies, radiative power and burned area    o These benefit public health/air quality as they serve as critical inputs for both real-time   smoke modeling and retrospective emissions inventory development.     Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Air Quality-Fire  Themes  3    Any and all data/observations which provide valuable soils, atmospheric, oceanographic,   vegetation, climatic, geologic, hydrologic, etc. information that can help decision makers face   the environmental and social challenges ahead.   Air Quality    Tools that allow us to better characterize pollution in the atmosphere, and to detect fires and   land use changes – to do a better job modeling emissions and air quality and to see changes   over time.    Measurements of air pollutants, including ozone, CO, formaldehyde, aerosol properties and   abundance, nitrogen oxides. These correspond to OMI and MOPITT observations, with improved   algorithms to refine near-surface abundances.     o Chemical weather models use the atmospheric tracer CO to separate near-surface   concentrations from pollution aloft; MOPITT multi-spectral data are the paradigm for   this vertical information.     o OMI data and the upcoming (not NASA) TROPOMI data, plus upcoming TEMPO data   over North America are absolutely necessary for air quality decision support.    In the stratosphere a sensor similar to the MLS instrument would be invaluable for continuing   long-term measurements. Integral validation schemes should be in place to corroborate satellite   measurements and to bridge gaps between satellite missions.   Suggestions for additional investments include:    Air Quality    Air quality (near-surface air pollutant) observations, particularly those with co-benefits for   mitigating climate change, leading with methane.    o These observations (methane, CO [not CO2], NO2, aerosol, and others) with dual benefits   to climate and air quality are under-represented or absent in NASA's portfolio.   o The communities involved are generally capable of using the large datasets produced by   satellites.   o The direct impact of this information on national and international climate and air   quality policy is enormous.   o On a 20-year, policy-relevant timeframe, methane’s global warming potential is 86 times   that of CO2. Satellite methane measurements are needed to support methane   reductions.    Modeled near-surface atmospheric fields at high resolution could enhance understanding of   heat stress experienced by urban dwellers and improve linkages between urban form and health   outcomes.    Global geostationary air quality monitoring (including the Southern Hemisphere)   o High time-resolved air quality measurements of atmospheric gases and aerosols – AOD,   NO2, CO, NH3, and ozone retrievals for the troposphere.       o Will help understand the evolution of pollution plumes and lead to insights about   diurnal variations and the impact of pollutants on human health.    Anthropogenically forced environmental changes are an unknown.      Whitepaper from Broad Remote Sensing Audience – Air Quality-Fire  Themes  4   o Changing energy production, chemical feedstocks, population concentration effect the   air environment.    o Focused measurements of urban air quality, targeting the oxidizing capacity, help to   understand the effect of the gross pollution production in dense human environments.   Wildfires    Fire detections, fire emissions, and their impact on regional air quality.    Improved wildland fire monitoring during fire season in the US at both strategic and tactical   levels.    Replace and improve the MODIS and VIIRS instruments that detect fire.    Higher spatial resolution satellite (about 10 m) with weekly temporal resolution to support   wildfire management – weather, erosion, soil moisture/temperature, vegetation moisture, and   species-level vegetation data to answer post-fire/post-disturbance vegetation and soil   stabilization recovery and treatment effectiveness questions.    Dedicated satellite for all stages of fire management/applications:   o Moderate to high spatial resolution   o Thermal bands with appropriate saturation thresholds to support characterizations of   active fire properties   o VIS, NIR and SWIR bands for post-fire burn area mapping, severity characterization and   assessing live fuel conditions   o High temporal frequency    More frequent collection for fire and other emergency responses for daily thermal monitoring at   1 m resolution.   o Every other day cover is needed for Landsat.    o Two collections each month coverage is an issue for event coverage, due to cloud cover.     NDVI products directly from Landsat. Improved land fire data with increased accuracy and   annual refresh.    Carbon-identifying services or sensors would be huge in the wildfire community to understand   carbon released or trapped by fires.

Attendees of the 2014 NASA workshop on Outstanding Questions in Atmospheric Composition identified  the future of air quality in the developing world as the number one priority for tropospheric composition  research over the next few decades.  As noted in the workshop report [https://espo.nasa.gov/home  /content/NASA_SMD_Workshop], the developing world is experiencing rapid industrialization in  combination with high population density and limited emission controls, leading to serious air quality  problems [Cohen et al., 2005].  A recent study showed that more than 4000 people die every day in  China from particulate matter (PM) exposure [Rohde and Muller, 2015], and given that ozone has also  been linked to premature mortality [Jerrett et al., 2009, 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2015], the total death toll  associated with air pollution is likely even higher.  While China receives much of the international  attention on this issue, other locations in South Asia and Africa also have dangerously poor air quality  [e.g. Tawari and Abowei, 2012; Liousse et al., 2014].  In the tropics, smoke from biomass burning is  becoming a major public health issue as it affects population centers [Pavagadhi et al., 2013].   Worldwide, air pollution is believed to kill more people than AIDS, malaria, breast cancer, or  tuberculosis [WHO, 2014; WHO, 2012; O’Keefe, 2013; Yang et al., 2013].  Underscoring the importance  of this topic, the GEO-CAPE Atmospheric Science Working Group (ASWG) endorsed it as a critical  research and applications need at a recent community workshop. This ASWG represents a broad cross- section of ~35 scientists from universities and government laboratories who have contributed to pre- formulation studies for the air quality component of the GEO-CAPE mission recommended by the 2007  Decadal Survey [http://geo-cape.larc.nasa.gov/].    The 2014 NASA workshop report identified four science questions associated with air quality in the  developing world, paraphrased here and listed in order of importance:   1. What are the emissions associated with major sources of pollution in the developing world and  how are these emissions related to near-surface ozone and PM?   2. How will changing patterns of energy-related and agricultural emissions driven by urbanization  affect local and regional air quality and what are the consequences for global tropospheric  composition?   3. Can we develop a space-based observing system for global air quality, with spatial and temporal  resolution relevant for determining public exposure to ozone and PM, that can be used to issue  air quality warnings?   4. How do extreme air quality events form and evolve in these understudied regions and how do  they affect global composition?         Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  The issue of air quality in the developing world is extremely timely because the next few decades are  crucial in terms of providing scientists and policy makers with the information they need to monitor,  understand, and reduce air pollution in order to protect populations and to achieve concomitant short- term climate benefits. There has been much progress made in recent years toward the application of  satellite measurements to air quality issues, as exemplified by the NASA AQAST team  [http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/aqast], which has pioneered new techniques and approaches for utilizing  measurements from the current generation of low-Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites to aid air quality  managers at the local, state, and national level.  Further, advances in multispectral retrievals have  demonstrated capability for near-surface measurements of carbon monoxide and ozone [Worden et al.,  2010, 2013; Fu et al., 2013; Cuesta et al., 2013], with the potential to provide better understanding of  the effects of air pollution on humans and ecosystems. Most critically, NASA (through the GEO-CAPE  ASWG) and ESA have started to work with the air quality community to prepare for and exploit the  expected high volume of high spatiotemporal resolution measurements of ozone, aerosols, and  precursor species from the upcoming geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) missions TEMPO (NASA), GEMS  (KARI), and Sentinel 4 (ESA).  This “virtual constellation” has led to a set of well-defined measurement  requirements for space-based observations of air quality [e.g. Fishman et al., 2012; GEO-CAPE, 2015]  and is expected to revolutionize the use of satellite measurements for air quality applications and  operational services.  However, it will be focused on the developed regions of the Northern  midlatitudes.  There is a critical need for similar high spatiotemporal resolution measurements focused  on developing nations in the tropics and subtropics.   Precedent for partnership between NASA and governments in the developing world has already been  established through the NASA – U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) SERVIR program  [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/servir/overview.html].  SERVIR provides satellite data, predictive  models and science applications to help improve environmental decision-making among developing  nations in parts of Africa, the Hindu-Kush region, and Southeast Asia.  SERVIR strengthens the ability of  governments and other stakeholders to incorporate Earth observations and geospatial technologies to  respond to natural disasters, improve food security, safeguard human health, and manage natural  resources.   While the quantitative application of satellite data to air quality decision-making is currently  out of the scope of SERVIR, the US-based input to air quality management for the Beijing Olympic Games  [Streets et al., 2007] provides an effective model for implementation.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges / questions?  To answer the science questions described above, we must be able to quantify emissions from various  sources and connect them to chemical processes and the subsequent production of ozone and PM near  the surface, where they impact human health.  Sparse surface measurements are insufficient for this  purpose, particularly in the developing world where surface networks are rudimentary at best. Aircraft  campaigns, which can be difficult to organize in developing regions, provide anecdotal data that cannot  easily be generalized to larger spatiotemporal scales.  Space-based measurements are thus critical  because they provide the spatial coverage and long, continuous record required to address these  science questions under a variety of environmental conditions.  The current generation of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites have provided a wealth of valuable  measurements for quantifying emissions [e.g. Jiang et al., 2015; Marais et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2014;     Huang et al., 2014; Ghude et al., 2013; Barkley et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013] and  understanding the processes controlling mid-tropospheric ozone [e.g. Verstraeten et al., 2015; Neu et  al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015].  The GEO-CAPE pre-formulation studies, however, have shown that once- per-day LEO measurements are insufficient for monitoring and understanding air quality.  These studies  indicate that observations must be made multiple times a day, at horizontal resolutions of ~10 km or  finer, and with as much near-surface sensitivity as possible in order to separate emissions sources at the  urban scale, quantify the contribution of transported pollution, understand diurnal and day-to-day  variability in emissions and chemical processing, and provide sufficient measurement statistics to enable  quantitative studies in cloudy regions [e.g. Fishman et al., 2012].    The TEMPO, Sentinel-4, and GEMS geostationary satellites will achieve many of the measurements  needed to address these goals over the regions surrounding the United States, Europe, and Korea,  respectively, but large swaths of the developing world will remain uncovered.  Furthermore, none of  these missions will incorporate TIR measurements that help to identify biomass burning plumes (e.g.  peroxyacetyl nitrate and formic acid [Alvarado et al., 2011]) and constrain agricultural emissions (e.g.  ammonia [Zhu et al., 2013] and, when combined with UV/VIS measurements, provide the most robust  sensitivity to near-surface ozone [Natraj et al., 2011; Zoogman et al., 2011].    The Sentinel 5P/5, METOP, and JPSS satellites will provide global LEO coverage of many of the relevant  species once per day, but will lack the spatiotemporal resolution needed to understand and quantify air  pollution processes. Therefore a space-based mission is needed that measures critical air quality and  biomass burning species multiple times per day, with as much coverage as possible over South and  Central America, Africa, and South Asia (where many current and emerging megacities are located).   There are several potential implementation approaches for such a mission, including additional GEO  instruments to complement the spatial coverage of Sentinel 4, TEMPO, and GEMS; companion LEO  instruments to complement the temporal coverage of Sentinel 5, METOP, and JPSS; and a set of 2 LEO  orbiters in opposing near-equatorial orbits covering 30oS-30oN.  The geostationary option offers the  advantage of a hosted payload approach using planned geostationary communications satellites. Since  these satellites provide commercial services, operation of air quality instruments for the benefit of the  developing world could conceivably be supported by public/private partnerships including philanthropic  organizations. NASA and other space agencies could partner with governments in the developing world  to build native capacity for air quality monitoring and prediction featuring the operational use of these  measurements.       A space-based mission to study air quality in the developing world would serve the air quality, public  health, and chemistry-climate interactions communities and provide a wealth of scientific and public  health-relevant information to allow us to answer the critical science questions described here. Space- based observations will foster interest in aircraft campaigns and ground-based measurements to obtain  additional correlative data.  While such a mission would not be focused on the US, it serves national  interests by providing information that can help to improve societal and political stability around the  world and can be used to quantify and help reduce the long-range transport of air pollution. With the  addition of CH4 and CO2 measurements, it could help to identify optimal solutions for mitigating climate  warming through reduction of climate forcers (see companion white paper on “Understanding the Co- Evolution of Air Quality and Climate Forcing in a Rapidly Changing World”) or, when combined with  ecosystem measurements, can contribute to ensuring global food security (see companion paper on “Air  Quality Effects on Crop and Ecosystem Health”).

We seek the multi-parameter dataset necessary to facilitate transformative atmosphere-ocean science by resolving, in space and time, the life-cycles of mesoscale convective systems (MCS), system-by-system, throughout the global maritime tropics.  The four-dimensional organization and energy transfers across scales in tropical convective systems is a fundamental and poorly understood process that underlies a broad spectrum of weather and climate phenomena that are among the most energetic on our planet.  These include, tropical cyclogenesis, monsoon dynamics, the formation and initial propagation of atmospheric rivers, Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) active phases, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm and cold events, and the dynamics of tropical convergence zones.  Tropical convection processes provide the canonical examples of upscale energy transfers in turbulent geophysical systems, including dynamics and thermodynamics associated with vertical transports of momentum and material properties, changes in phase and the mechanisms for self-aggregation.  Maritime tropical MCS provide a representative and resolvable target signal within the multi-scale ranges of these processes from which we might infer and quantify the organization and scale transfers leading to the larger-scale phenomena affecting the planet.  Life-cycle stages for maritime tropical MCS define the time and space scales to be observed by multi-sensor systems necessary to capture essential dynamic and thermodynamic signals.  To understand, quantify and predict larger-scale phenomena, we should seek to revisit evolving maritime MCS in their respective tropical ocean basins, several times during their individual life-cycles. This implies bursts of repeat sampling with revisits on the order of an hour in a variety of infrared and microwave frequencies, resolving spatial scales on the order of a few kilometers within areal coverages spanning thousands of kilometers.  Essential dynamical and thermodynamical variables to be simultaneously measured directly and/or inferred include: surface wind convergence and divergence; sea surface temperature (SST); total column and multi-layer water vapor content; total-column and multi-layer temperature, surface rain rate; and cloud-top temperature.  These data are not available, on hourly timescales, as a coordinated and simultaneously measured set, from existing or planned sensors: an active/passive wide-swath sensor system in very low-inclination orbit is needed.  Beyond fundamental scientific questions regarding conditions and processes of aggregation and convective organization, detecting important MCS evolutions on their naturally occurring timescales will enhance forecast and analysis systems, and add value to in-situ data and observations from existing and planned polar-orbiting systems that will cross the low-inclination orbit implied here up to 14 times each day.  For example, as hourly, multi-sensor satellite observations targeting maritime tropical MCS establish an evolving background state, aircraft missions can be designed and modified in near-real time to detect essential fine-scale features of developing tropical storms and cyclones; thereby improving intensity estimates and forecasts on longer lead times.  On longer timescales, repeated detection of the evolution and organization of MCS processes in tropical regions will enhance forecast estimates for onset and break periods in the monsoon systems of the global tropics.  Repeated observations of MCS building-blocks during MJO active phases will help diagnose elusive propagation mechanisms and interactions with ENSO regimes, perhaps as functions of tropical Indian and western Pacific ocean basins.  The intricacies of the evolution of MCS moisture processes; i.e., at the air-sea interface, within and above the planetary boundary layer, and integrated over the tropospheric column, will help address problematic time and space scales in closing budgets for global, regional and local hydrologic cycles.  Hourly, multi-platform observations in the global maritime tropics will anchor optimal interpolations that underlie important Level 3 and Level 4 datasets for rain rate, total column water vapor etc.  These datasets are providing important new insights on land-falling rain systems in mid-latitude coastal regions (e.g., atmospheric rivers as in the `Pineapple Express` and others) that are required to manage extended periods of drought and shifts in rainfall patterns associated with a warming climate.    2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially    with respect to readiness?  Key science questions and feasible space-borne observations are just now converging such that technical risk is manageable and transformative dataset collection is possible.  The relevant set of currently-feasible space-borne observations infer tropical convective system processes on scales that are now fine enough to capture MCS evolution; e.g., they are larger and longer than the scale of individual convective plumes, but fine enough to detect organized convective system behaviors.  Conversely, the resolvable scales from space document processes too fine to be resolved in the current state-of-the-art large-scale and global climate models (GCMs).  Indeed, tropical dynamic and thermodynamic processes on the MCS scale are the objects of critical parameterizations receiving an abundance of current research attention. A minimal set of basin-by-basin observations, across several seasons, MJOs and ENSO regimes, will provide essential background for enhancing those critical parameterizations.  More realistic simulations of monsoons, MJOs and ENSO warm events are necessary to add value to important climate forecasts with obvious societal implications.  A minimal set of key dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the life-cycle evolution of global maritime tropical MCS are now within reach of space-borne observing system capabilities.  An integration and enhancement of existing infrared and active and passive measurement systems on a single platform, in a broad-swath and very low-inclination orbit configuration, will be an essential technical achievement.  Given existing and planned US and international space-borne observing systems, these technical enhancements pose surprisingly low technical risk.  The essential component for the space-borne observing system to resolve global maritime tropical MCS life-cycle evolution is the very low inclination orbit necessary to resolve inherent temporal scales.  Preliminary studies suggest that broad-swath coverage in orbits inclined from 12° to 18° would span the global tropics (i.e., ± 23.5°).  Burst samples of 5 to 7 repeats, at 100 minute intervals, would precess around the globe such that tropical locations experience burst sampling about twice in every 24-hour period. Several years of data at these temporal resolutions, and at high spatial and radiometric resolutions, will provide basin-specific composites for MCS evolution that can be used to add value to a variety of future observations from polar-orbiting (i.e., higher inclination) systematic observing systems, leading to skillful parameterizations in regional and global forecast models.  Drivers for the dataset to quantify life-cycle stages of MCS in global tropical ocean basins derive from insights gained across a variety of research and operational communities given data from heritage instruments across multiple space-borne missions.  Seminal datasets for surface convergence derive from an international line of scatterometer missions (e.g., ERS, NSCAT, QuikSCAT, ASCAT, OSCAT, etc.).  Passive microwave observations leading to SST, total column and multi-layer moisture and temperature datasets derive from SSM/I's, AMSR's, WindSAT, TRMM, etc.  Cloud profile and cloud-top temperature data build insights into MCS variability and stem from missions and programs like TRMM, CloudSat, GOES, Aura, Aqua and the MeteoSats.  Examples of field programs focused on processes involving tropical MCS include DYNAMO and TOGA COARE.  Relevant research and operational communities span the sub-fields of climate, air-sea interaction processes, geophysical fluid dynamics, weather and ocean forecasting.  As impacts from a warming climate accumulate,the combined efforts of these communities will be required to address critical societal issues regarding fresh-water resources, natural hazards including droughts, floods and fires, and planning for and changes in agricultural practices (e.g., in response to changes in monsoons, MJOs and ENSO). The multi-parameter dataset defined here forms a basis for collaborations in data analysis and model-building across these communities.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these     challenges/questions?  While convective processes in general (i.e., including terrestrial systems, mid- and high-latitude systems) are fundamental to the general circulation and variabilities from mesoscale to synoptic to global scales, maritime tropical MCS occur and evolve on Earth in a low-latitude belt that uniquely affords frequent sampling revisits via space-borne platforms in low-Earth orbit, resolving timescales that match those of essential component dynamical and thermodynamical processes spanning the MCS life-cycle.  The maritime tropical MCS targets are too large, and evolve and propagate too rapidly for sufficient coverage by in-situ or airborne observing systems.  Cloud-penetrating microwave signals, both passive and active, afford coincident detection of component dynamical and thermodynamical variables within evolving maritime MCS (i.e., including SST, surface vector wind, rain rate, two layer and total column atmospheric temperatures and moisture, etc.).  Attempts to build and validate composite life-cycles for MCS, based on multi-platform space-borne and in-situ observations, have not been sufficient to support parameterizations leading to much-needed enhancements in simulations of monsoon, MJO, ENSO and/or tropical storm variability in our most sophisticated models. Instead, superparameterization methods embed higher resolution two-dimensional (x,z) cloud-resolving model `curtains` within GCM grid intervals to integrate GCM-scale thermodynamics on finer spatial and temporal scales, feeding back the integrated (and balanced) variables to the GCM each timestep. This suggests missing understanding possibly involving: a) basin-specific processes (e.g., differences in convective organization processes in the West Pacific warm pool vs. the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone vs. the easterly wave regime in the tropical Atlantic, etc.); and/or b) MCS-specific interactions with regional large-scale circulations and regimes in which the MCS are embedded (e.g., including weather systems, tropical SST regimes, phases of the MJO, etc.).  Wide areal, system-by-system, high temporal and spatial resolution, coincident multi-sensor observations of evolving global tropical maritime MCS will reveal mechanisms and provide insights necessary to enhance understanding and facilitate forecasts and simulations of manifold processes affecting weather and climate for the globe.     1                                                         /docProps/thumbnail.jpeg  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"ziad haddad::david long::brian mapes::david randall::frank wentz::"}

File of White Paper (1500 word limit):  Infrared Radiance Intercalibration for Climate Quality Products and Benchmarking  Principal Author: David Tobin Co-authors: Henry Revercomb, Bruce Wielicki  There are many Earth system investigations of climate related processes and climate change that rely on observations which do not have the inherent accuracy and traceability for the intended use.  That is, data from sensors designed and tested based on weather related specifications are frequently used in studies to understand and track climate, yet lacking the required basic measurement characteristics.  Therefore, a key challenge which spans innumerous Earth System Science applications is to understand, and improve if possible, the accuracy of NOAA, NASA, and international satellite products.  In particular, a challenge is to improve the radiance calibration accuracy of the large suite of infrared sensor observations including those from, for example, AIRS, IASI, CrIS, MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, HIRS, and GOES.   This improvement is possible with the proposed Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission (Wielicki et al. 2013) which would provide coincident infrared observations that can be used for intercalibration. CLARREO will provide infrared observations with absolute calibration with uncertainty better than 0.1K 3-sigma and with in-orbit calibration verification.  Analogous improvements for reflected solar observations are also possible via high accuracy CLARREO reflected solar observations.   The resulting improved calibration and characterization of the calibration uncertainties will provide benefits in two main areas: 1) improved radiances and derived products from the individual intercalibrated sensors, and 2) the ability of the intercalibrated radiance observations to contribute to the construction of a climate radiance benchmark.   The need for this type of reference observation capability is recognized and has been discussed in recent publications.  For example, the need is summarized in the 2013 WMO/CEOS/CGMS report “Strategy Towards an Architecture for Climate Monitoring from Space” (Dowell et al. 2013):  “To characterize climate and climate change, data need to be accurate and homogeneous over long time scales. The signals important for the detection of climate change can easily be lost in the noise of a changing observing system. This enforces the need for continuity in an observing system, where observations can be tied to an invariant reference. Such a system needs to be maintained over at least several decades and beyond. It is with these boundary conditions that a climate monitoring architecture needs to be formulated.” Currently the international intercalibration community, organized around the Global Space based Inter Calibration System (GSICS, Goldberg et al. 2011), utilizes IASI, AIRS, and CrIS to serve as “reference sensors” for the intercalibration of other infrared observations, despite the relatively large uncertainty in these observations and the lack of in-orbit verification and traceability that is needed for the rigorous metrology required for climate studies and associated societal decisions.  Other than CLARREO, there are no other existing or planned programs that will provide this capability.  This is a challenge which must involve improved spaced based observations, and other existing and planned programs lack the high accuracy and in-orbit traceability required for this challenge.   The CLARREO mission was chosen as one of four Tier 1 missions in the 2007 Decadal Survey, and is currently in an extended definition phase.  The science objectives (including this infrared intercalibration objective) and the required sensors for CLARREO are well defined and ready to go.  Now is a crucial time for this challenge, as direct comparisons of CLARREO observations with concurrent sensors, including AIRS with its record starting in 2003 and IASI-A in 2007, have the potential to provide valuable data on the accuracy of the existing datasets before these missions reach the end of their lifetimes.  There are many groups that will potentially be included in these intercalibration efforts, including the CLARREO science team, other various individual sensors and product teams, and the intercalibration community, namely GSICS.  The CLARREO mission, with its primary climate benchmarking objective along with its potential benefits for the entire suite of infrared sensor observations via intercalibration, is certainly important for this Decadal Survey and deserves a strong recommendation to proceed expeditiously.

Joseph Turk1, Susan van den Heever2, Svetla Hristova-Veleva1, Jeff L. Steward1     1 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA  2 Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO       Q1: What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the  coming decade?    A big challenge for NASA’s Earth System Science over the coming decade will be how  to utilize its current and future capacities in Earth observations and Earth system  modeling to address the supply and demand for available fresh water, influenced by  growing populations and changing climates.  At its core, the hydrological cycle is driven  by weather systems that have exhibited wide variability in regional precipitation extremes  over the past decade.  While weather covers storm-scale phenomena with time scales  from minutes to weeks, it also covers the sub-seasonal time scale that bridges weather  with longer-term climate and societal implications, such as drought, water storage and  supply, agricultural practices and food supply.    NASA has made significant investments within the past decades on weather-related  observations, modeling, and science and technology that address specific components of  the hydrological cycle.   A key challenge for the coming decade will be the coupling and  integration of a wide variety of weather-related Earth observations with increasingly  sophisticated and interconnected Earth system models.   Observations from precipitation  and cloud missions such as TRMM/GPM and CloudSat, respectively, have succeeded in  observing the global mapping of precipitation, its regional variability, and dimensional  characteristics and features of precipitating cloud structures such as their vertical  structure (Zipser et. al., 2006; Liu, 2011).  Yet a more complete understanding of the  physical and dynamical processes leading to precipitation development are not well  understood.  The joint dynamics and microphysics governing the evolution of embryonic  cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation-sized hydrometeors that influence the  intensity and severity of weather systems, are not well represented by current cloud  resolving model (CRM) resolutions and parameterizations (Varble et. al., 2014).  For  example, as the CRM resolution becomes finer, so does the sensitivity to the associated  choices of parameterizations for unresolved sub-grid processes (Bryan and Morrison,  2012).  The generation of supersaturation within the model and the subsequent aerosol  activation and droplet growth is highly sensitive to the simulated vertical velocity  (Saleeby and Cotton, 2004).  Therefore, incorrectly representing vertical velocity can  result in incorrect nucleation rates, cloud droplet numbers and sizes, and the vertical  distribution of cloud water throughout the cloud.       Improvements to convective and microphysical parameterization schemes have been  impeded in the past by several factors, including the lack of collocated observations of  vertical velocity and microphysical characteristics on convective spatial and temporal  scales, and shortfalls in our understanding of the multiple ways in which ice species  nucleate, form and grow.  From an observational perspective, it is difficult to observe and  represent these multi-scale interactions that are critical to convective organization and  evolution from infrequent, intermittent satellite or aircraft-based observations of quickly  evolving processes.   More frequent and collocated observations are desired to enhance  the capability to resolve the spatio-temporal details regarding the vertical motion,  microphysical processes, and the feedbacks between the vertical motion and the  microphysical processes, necessary to properly validate the simulate the role of  convective storms in the vertical and horizontal transport, redistribution and processing of  atmospheric water vapor, latent energy and momentum, trace gases and aerosols.     As the increasing number of space-based weather-related Earth observations comes the  challenge to integrate the information gained from these cloud-process observations back  into both CRMs and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models via data assimilation.   Advancements in 4D-variational assimilation systems now routinely assimilate GNSS  radio occultations and radiances from microwave and infrared sounders onboard  operational low Earth-orbiting weather satellites, but the latter data are often “thinned” or  blacklisted once they get too close to clouds, and their horizontal resolutions are more  representative of the environment surrounding severe weather, as opposed to the  conditions within the cloud systems themselves.  Also, certain channels are not used in  the over-land observations.   As a result, only a very small percentage of the cloud and  precipitation affected observations are assimilated into NWP models (Bauer et. al.,  2011).  For microwave radiances, radiative transfer models (forward and adjoint) are the  forward operators that allow a mapping or “bridge” between observation and model space  (Bennartz and Greenwald, 2011).  Therefore, the same cloud process observations cold  lead to improvements in the forward operators to maintain better consistency in model- observation space, improving the model’s ability to assimilate and retain observations in  and near clouds.    A recent NASA workshop on scientific challenges in the weather focus area  (http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/focus-areas/earth-weather/) identified a sustained  modeling and assimilation framework, together with the transition of research-type Earth  observations into operational systems at NOAA/NWS, as central to the ongoing  development and success of NASA’s Weather Focus Area.  Therefore, in the coming  decade, a major challenge to water cycle science, weather applications and operational  utilization will be the integration of observations of cloud scale processes to into CRMS  to correctly represent vertical motions, microphysical processes, and the feedbacks  between the vertical motion and the microphysical processes, and the use of the  knowledge gained into improve the utilization and retention of cloud and precipitation- affected observations in model data assimilation systems.      Q2: Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now, especially with     respect to readiness?    Weather is often envisioned in terms of its severity, such as tornadic activity, flash  floods, large hail, snowstorms or landfalling hurricanes.  However, weather is also the  opposite of these conditions, such as sustained periods of heat and scant precipitation, or  more subtle changes such the freezing level and its effects on snowpack retention and  water supplies.    These conditions can change quickly from one year to the next, but the  needs and requirements for water-related applications require adequate planning and  steady investment thereafter.  The observational capabilities of the NOAA’s  geostationary and sun-synchronous low Earth-orbiting platforms (GOES-R series and  JPSS, respectively) will extend current sounding capabilities (CrIS/ATMS) and near  cloud-top imaging (VIIRS) well into the next decade.  While NASA’s most recent and  near-future observing missions are positioned to observe phenomena that are related to  various components of the water cycle (e.g., precipitation from GPM, soil moisture from  SMAP, evapotranspiration from ECOSTRESS, groundwater from GRACE-FO, surface  water from SWOT), there is a observational gap for frequent cloud process observations  of vertical air motion of fine spatial (1-km or less) scale, and direct observations within  the clouds and boundary layer at the time scales of the cloud-to-precipitation processes,  such as cloud nucleation and the aforementioned vertical transport.  Increasingly, there  are now many microwave component technologies, compact radar systems at  cloud/precipitation relevant frequencies (35 GHz and above) antenna designs, satellite  orbits (including geostationary) and constellation strategies, and signal processing  techniques that have been brought down to a reasonable cost and level of complexity to  make cloud-scale process observations feasible, including several which have been  already demonstrated.  These opportunities can be explored through more frequent and  coordinated opportunities such as NASA’s Earth Ventures (EV) or related programs.  For  the needs for assimilation of cloud and precipitation affected radiances and radar  observations, an expanded and sustained investment to the NASA/NOAA/DoD Joint  Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) through its partner agencies is  recommended, and a natural forum to train future scientists with the specialized  knowledge needed in this topic area.      Q3: Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     The physics that describe weather systems cross telescoping spatial and temporal scales.   Surface networks and radars require dense spacing and careful intercalibration, represent  mostly near-surface meteorology, are more abundant and available in certain parts of the  world, and are mostly over land.  Space-based observations provide the more globally  complete picture of weather systems, but are currently taken from various low-Earth  orbiting satellite platforms with different orbits, scanning strategies, sensor designs or  operating bands.  Cross-calibration programs such as the CGMS Global Space-Based  Intercalibration System (GSICS) have already recognized this and have programs in  place to monitor the quality of satellite observations taken from self-similar sensors.  The  GPM mission, with its asynchronous orbit and partner/constellation-based observational     design, and the A-Train with its space/time-aligned sensor formation flying, represent  current complementary collections of observations that are more useful to cloud-to- precipitation process studies relevant to water cycle modeling, but provide an incomplete  picture.  Future space-based microwave observations that concurrently capture the finer- scale microphysical and dynamical time scales of the cloud-to-precipitation process, and  the localized environmental conditions, are at the core of improvements to CRM  modeling and assimilation into NWP models.  The high frequency and collocated nature  of these observations would present significant spatio-temporal details regarding the  vertical motion, microphysical processes, and the feedbacks between the vertical motion  and the microphysical processes.

The World Ocean absorbs, transports, and releases a vast amount of heat that feeds climate and weather systems. Ocean Heat Content (OHC) can be estimated using surface and subsurface measures of temperature. While space borne measures of sea surface temperature (SST) yield abundant spatial coverage, in situ measures of subsurface temperature are more dominantly used to estimate OHC given their vertical extent. World OHC for 0–2000 m and 700–2000 m (Figure 1) reveal that approximately one third of the total warming of the upper 2000 m of the ocean is derived from the 700–2000 m layer (Levitus et. al, 2012).   Figure 1. World OHC pentadal time series for 0–2000 m and 700–2000 m (from Levitus et al, 2012). Vertical bars represent +/-2 times the standard error about the pentadal estimate for the 0–2000 m estimates and the grey-shaded area represent +/-2 times the standard error about the pentadal estimate for the 0–700 m estimates, where pentadal estimates are plotted at the midpoint of the 5-year period.   Space-based Sea Surface Height (SSH) altimeter data can also be used to estimate OHC. As detailed in Jayne et al. (2002), an increasing number of studies use satellite altimeters to estimate OHC changes [Gill and Niiler, 1973; Repert et al., 1985; White and Tai, 1995; Hendricks et al., 1996; Wang and Koblinski, 1997; Chambers et al., 1997, 1998; Leuliette and Wahr, 1999; Sato et al., 2000; Polito et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2000; Ferry et al., 2000; Jayne et al., 2002].  Improved understanding of altimeter SSH ocean signals provided a gateway into extracting the OHC. Jayne et al. (2002) combined satellite altimetry for sea surface height (SSH) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite for mass changes (transfer of water between land and ocean) to isolate ocean heat content.  In situ measurements can be used to decompose SSH into barotropic and baroclinic components and when combined, show complete agreement with altimeter SSH measurements (Baker-Yeboah et. al., 2010). Shay and Brewster (2010) and Meyers et al. (2014) developed a revised algorithm, which estimates the depth of the 20⁰C and 26⁰C isotherms as well as mixed layer depth (MLD) from satellite altimetry and in situ profiles (Argo, XBT) and mooring data.  This information is then combined with SST from satellite to calculate ocean heat content.  This is the basis for a NOAA operational product that calculates OHC daily (Figures 2-3, http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/ocean/ ocean_heat.html).      Figure 2. Altimeter sea surface height and in situ based estimate of 20° (left panel) and 26° (right panel) isotherm depths.   A different approach is posited by Tyler et al. (under review), which applies changes in the conductivity of the ocean to calculate OHC.  Conductivity is measured routinely by Argo floats and other oceanographic instruments, but is usually converted to salinity before use.  Tyler et al. (under review) construct a long-term mean conductivity climatology at different depths in the ocean that can then be used as a baseline, using geomagnetic data from the ESA magnetic field mission SWARM to get conductivity change and then changes in global ocean heat content. A comparison of both methods is needed to improve our assessment of OHC.   Figure 3. Altimeter and in situ derived ocean heat content: a NOAA operational product as described in Shay et al. (2015).   A Key Challenge. A key challenge is to provide a consistent decadal climate data record of satellite altimeter data, which can then be used to generate an operational decadal satellite based OHC product. With the upcoming launch plans for Jason 3 this December 2015 (U.S. and international programs) to aid the continuity of space borne time records of SSH altimeter data and the concerted effort of the NOAA Climate Data Record Program (see Privette, Zhao, and Kearns, 2015, companion white paper) to support operational Reference Environmental Data Records (REDRs), this is a timely effort, especially with respect to operational readiness. Space-based observations from altimeters and AVHRR sensors provide decadal records of high-resolution data that can be used to provide continuous assessments of ocean dynamics and OHC to improve our understanding of how climate and weather is changing. Comparing these estimates of OHC with in situ based estimates not only provide uncertainty bars for the calculation, but provide new insight on important environmental variables and ocean processes that relate to our changing weather (Shay, 2010; Jaimes et al., 2015) and climate patterns. Challenges summarized by Wijffels et. al (2010) continue to be addressed by the science and operational communities: to (a) sustain and increase our existing core observational systems above and within the vastly under sampled ocean, (b) fill data gaps in the global ocean temperature observing system for key regions such as the deep ocean, ice-covered oceans and marginal seas, (c) reconstruct historical ocean temperature changes from records with the challenges of data quality and instrument biases (identification and removal), and (d) extend existing short term forecasting observation systems into climate monitoring and prediction systems, given concerns with accuracy, meta-data, as well as archiving. Important stakeholders have been addressed in a companion white paper (Privette, Zhao, and Kearns, 2015). Overall, SST and OHC are important environmental variables in the study of Ocean Climate and Weather and this study supports the examination of both in situ and satellite data from an operational perspective within NOAA over an extended time period for decadal studies.

What are the key challenges for Earth System Science in the coming decade?  The 21st century poses extreme challenges for the sustainable management of the Earth’s water resources at all levels from the local to the global scale.  The international climate community through the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) has identified the issues underlying water availability, climate extremes and cloud influences on climate as three of the grand challenges facing both our understanding of and ability to adapt to climate change (http://wcrp-climate.org/grand-challenges). Three basic questions posed by WCRP are how will the availability of fresh water change in the coming decades, what is the predictability of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes at seasonal to decadal time scales, and how does convection shape cloud feedbacks? Since water is necessary for all life on Earth, knowing where, when and how clouds form, and whether they precipitate or not, is vital for all civilization. Central to these themes require better predictions of water at all scales. This requires a paradigm shift away from our current practices that largely observe “states” to future observing strategies that can deliver information on both states and “processes”.  Processes here refer to the production of precipitation within clouds that are in turn driven by dynamics that range in scale from the convective to the synoptic. Thus it becomes essential to understand at both the local and global scale the underlying cloud processes (via measurable proxies such as ice microphysics and vertical velocities) that result in precipitation for improving the next generation of climate and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.  As the resolutions of these climate models increase over time to be able to explicitly represent cloud and convective processes, it is equally imperative to plan for timely observations to constrain, evaluate and define these processes to produce more accurate predictions of the water cycle.    2. Why are these challenge/questions timely?  Climate models, which couple precipitation to the global changes in energy fluxes, show relatively small increasing trends in global precipitation in a manner consistent with observations.  At the same time, these models show relatively little skill reproducing regional precipitation changes. This problem is often attributed to the poor representation of clouds and convective systems, as well as the scale interactions that are ultimately responsible for the water budgets at local scales. The range of scales involved in these processes has led the community to push for resolutions that can explicitly capture clouds in climate models.  Computing capabilities have increased significantly so that global cloud-resolving scales are now becoming feasible and are being implemented in short-term climate simulations of months to years with anticipation to century+ simulations likely over the next decade.  Despite successful missions such as TRMM, GPM, and CloudSat, that excel at measuring current cloud structures, measurements to simultaneously constrain and evaluate cloud and precipitation processes in high-resolution models do not currently exist, ultimately resulting in large uncertainties in models.  Providing data to inform global cloud-resolving model development is thus timely.  Furthermore, elucidating cloud and precipitation processes is an essential step in Earth system science.  By processes, we mean the fundamental mechanisms governing the evolution of embryonic cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation sized particles, and the updrafts that support this growth, mechanisms that should be valid no matter what changes in the Earth’s circulation are predicted. We thus envision a process-oriented approach that allows for cloud microphysics and dynamics to be understood and parameterized for the different cloud systems developing in the various environmental regimes around the globe.  Measured statistics are desperately needed that couple in-cloud vertical velocities to resulting hydrometeor types and their profiles in order to improve the dynamical and microphysical parameterizations, and the feedbacks between them, in cloud-resolving models. While the cloud and precipitation communities have traditionally been separate, they are now coming together through this process-level view.   3. Why are space-based observations fundamental?  It is simply impossible to create cloud and precipitation process statistics with ground or aircraft measurements. Reliable statistics that cover the entire spectrum of processes over a heterogeneous Earth will require satellite-based global measurements.  Processes are a function of meteorology and environmental conditions within a regime. Many of these regimes are in very remote and hostile locations (high latitudes, remote oceans, etc.) so that even collecting data in brief field programs is prohibitive.  Instead, process questions may inevitably require that the spaceborne component be linked with well thought out and consistent experiments to support process modeling over short time scales.    Because aerosols, clouds and precipitation are inherently linked, missions such as ACE or their new incarnation after the 2017 Decadal survey are essential investments to increase the value of datasets for understanding cloud and precipitation processes. Indeed, the science proposed herein includes a subset of ACE’s objectives. Furthermore, connections between the water, hydrological, and radiative budget cycles necessitate that ancillary observations of these Earth system components would be extremely valuable for advancing the scientific and societal benefits of a cloud-precipitation measurement mission.  a. Are existing/planned programs sufficient to make substantial progress on the science?   NASA’s Precipitation Measurement Missions (TRMM and GPM), A-Train Missions, Cloud and Radiation Program, Weather Focus Area, and mission concept working groups such as ACE provide strong scientific leadership and instrumentation heritage for space-based observations of clouds and precipitation.  Together with the planned EarthCARE mission, these observations provide vital data for climate studies. Additional investments, both to enhance processes understanding (via multi-frequency/Doppler radars and wideband radiometers) and maintain data records, offer a way to make substantial progress on the cloud and precipitation process challenges by observing critical measurements of cloud parameter evolution and additional process information and placing these into a longer term context.  b. How does this science link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data? Lower resolution but broad scale satellite measurements over the globe establishes statistically robust interrelationships between processes and environment necessary to improve weather and climate models. However, high-resolution and intensive but localized/sporadic observations of weather processes from ground or suborbital assets provide details that are not otherwise attainable from space.  The value of combined cloud and precipitation data will be improvements to the fundamental understanding of real cloud and precipitation systems, ultimately leading to perfected parameterizations for predictions about changing fresh water supplies in both weather and climate models. Delivering 4-dimensional measurements of the space-time evolution of the properties of global clouds and precipitation will help to quantify regional and global water cycle processes and serve to provide a better understanding of storm structures, water/energy budgets, the atmospheric movement of water and interactions between precipitation and other environmental and climate parameters. Tying together the storm dynamics with the microphysics will lead to significant advances in relating cloud processes to environmental influences and regional sensitivities.  c.  What are the anticipated scientific and societal benefits? These cloud and precipitation measurements, while principally designed to advance our confidence in the hydrologic predictions of any future climate, will clearly also lead to advancements in applications such as: predicting high-impact natural hazard events such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and snowstorms; improving climate prediction through better understanding of surface water fluxes, soil moisture storage, cloud/precipitation microphysics and latent heat release in the atmosphere to improve Earth system modeling and analysis; and advancing NWP skills through more accurate and frequent measurements of cloud and precipitation vertical property profiles together with better quantitative error characterizations and data assimilation systems. Knowledge would also be gained in topics such as the evolution of circulations like the MJO that depend upon the dynamic coupling of cloud scales, monsoons, orographic systems, mid-latitude cyclonic storms and processes that determine the severity of precipitating weather systems. d. Who are the science communities that would be involved? Scientists from NASA, JPL, and universities and other government and international agencies were directly involved in our cloud and precipitation workshops (as listed at URL http://pmm.nasa.gov/CAPPM). Other scientists would include members from the cloud/radiative and precipitation communities; aerosol communities; land surface (soil moisture, vegetation, agriculture, etc.) communities; weather-related natural hazard communities; as well any scientist with water related research.  Specifically, the Water Resources and the Weather Focus community workshops mention cloud and precipitation data as essential (http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2015/08/03/Weather_Focus_Area_Workshop_Report_2015.pdf, https://eos.org/meeting-reports/satellite-data-for-water-resources-management). Given the fundamental importance of precipitation measurements, and the legacy of prior missions, a cloud and precipitation mission will likely include the involvement of foreign partners in contributing to important mission elements.   In closing, coupled measurements bring together the cloud and precipitation scientists from both the observational and modeling communities to provide guidance to models with respect to precipitating weather systems – how they form, how they evolve and how they dissipate, such that these clouds can be parameterized not just in today’s models, but in future models.

A key challenge in global human health is the degradation of air quality in the major population centers of developing countries.  The NASA GSFC group listed above presented this topic to the NASA workshop on Outstanding Questions in Atmospheric Composition, Chemistry, Dynamics and Radiation for the Coming Decade that was conducted at NASA Ames Research Center in May 2014.  This topic was voted as the top priority for atmospheric composition by the attendees of the workshop, demonstrating broad community support for future research on this issue.    Global population is expected to increase from ~7 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050 with most of the increase occurring in the developing world, including over half in Africa.  Today, many of the world’s megacities (>10 million population) exist in the developing world and their global number is expected to increase from 22 currently to 36 by 2050.  Air pollution, particularly in the developing world, is already the single largest environmental health risk, claiming 7 million lives annually (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/).  Extreme pollution events in China and India are often reported by the media, but they also occur frequently in large cities of the Middle East, Africa, South America, and other Asian countries (Zhu et al., 2012).  Major sources of air pollution in the developing world include motor vehicles, burning of household waste, domestic fuel (charcoal, wood, agricultural waste, dung), electricity generation, industry, and unpaved roads.  Naturally occurring aerosols (e.g., dust) are another regionally important contributor to air quality issues. In addition, urban populations can be strongly affected by large-scale biomass burning on a seasonal basis.  Megacities have large energy consumption and are concentrated sources of both pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  The air pollution created from these activities causes detrimental health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Many of the tropical and subtropical megacities exceed the WHO annual mean guidelines for PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations and exceed national and WHO standards for ozone.   Observations are needed to answer the following questions: - What is the current (i.e., baseline) impact of anthropogenic activities and natural emissions on urban air quality, tropospheric composition, and climate? - How will emissions of trace gases, greenhouse gases, and aerosols change over the coming decades from urbanization, economic development, and policy decisions? - To what extent does biomass burning pollution affect megacity air quality and how will these emissions change in response to population growth in the developing world? - What will be the effects of population growth and spatial distribution on weather and climate (aerosol radiative forcing, temperature and water vapor changes, etc.)?   Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Most of the population growth in the coming decades will be in urban areas of developing countries, thereby deteriorating air quality.  For example, Liousse et al. (2014) estimate that ~50% of global organic carbon emissions of particulate matter could be from Africa by 2030.  Air quality will be monitored hourly by satellite over much of the heavily populated regions of the Northern Hemisphere by the geostationary constellation of TEMPO, Sentinel 4 and GEMS by ~2019.  However, this constellation will not cover Central and South America, much of Africa, and parts of the Middle East and South Asia -- regions with expected explosive population growth and air quality degradation.  Therefore without additional space-borne instruments, fine-resolution diurnal measurements of air quality in the tropics and subtropics will not be possible.  The ability to monitor air quality and changing emission patterns from space has been proven from low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites such as Aura, Aqua, Terra, ENVISAT, and METOP.  UV-Vis and IR instruments on these platforms have demonstrated ability to monitor NO2, HCHO, SO2, CO, (CHO)2, and aerosols.  However, near-surface ozone monitoring will require simultaneous UV/Vis/TIR observations on new platforms.  To understand contributions of various emission sources will require finer spatial and temporal resolution than is provided by the current LEO instruments.  The LEO Sentinel 5P TROPOMI instrument due to be launched in 2016 will provide 7-km horizontal resolution, but will still only provide one observation per day.  Such data will be insufficient to better understand the chemical processing that occurs in the diurnal evolution of ozone and in the buildup of aerosol loading. To ensure that major urban areas are sufficiently sampled every day, geostationary observations are required. The necessary instrument technology exists to perform these observations.  Alpert et al. (2012) have examined trends in AOD over the world’s largest cities using data from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and MISR over the period 2002 – 2010.  AOD in large cities in West Africa show upward trends from all three sensors.  In some major cities of South America there is disagreement between the sensors in terms of the direction of the trend, leaving considerable uncertainty concerning air quality trends for aerosols.  Duncan et al. (2015) computed the trends in NO2 over 2005 to 2014 for a number of cities worldwide as measured by OMI on the Aura satellite.  Figure 1 shows the percentage change in tropospheric NO2 column amounts over this period for three African cities (Cairo, Nairobi, and Luanda).  Strong positive trends are detected in each of these metropolitan areas, demonstrating the effects of explosive population growth and economic development in these regions.  These trends urgently call for more comprehensive monitoring of air quality in the developing world in the near future.               Figure 1.   OMI tropospheric column NO2 trends over 2005 to 2014 for Cairo (upper left), Nairobi (upper right), and Luanda (lower left).  Gray values indicate no significant trend.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Most tropical and subtropical cities lack continuous, sustained air quality monitoring at surface sites, and while there are more measurements available from South American cities, the reliability and accessibility of the data are less than desired.  Therefore, geostationary satellite observations are required to estimate air quality levels throughout the day such that pollution warnings can be issued.  Suborbital observations would clearly aid in establishing baseline data.  One or two prototype urban areas should be selected for intensive sampling.  Perhaps an international consensus concerning needed suborbital and surface field programs would be required before such experiments could be conducted.  International partners would also likely be desirable in conducting such measurements.  Suborbital research should also contain components that examine impacts of biomass fires on air quality and on GHG emissions, in addition to urban impacts.  The existing and planned LEO instruments provide at best one or two observations per day.  This limited temporal coverage limits characterization of pollution sources on diurnal scales and limits the determination of pollutant transport and spatial variability.  Clouds are a hindrance to polar orbiting observations during the wet season.  Hourly observations from a geostationary platform increase the probability of obtaining cloud-free scenes.  Many of the existing instruments are approaching the ends of their lifetimes.  Therefore: · Geostationary UV/VIS/NIR/TIR observations are needed over the tropics and subtropics to measure hourly O3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, CO, CH4, (CHO)2, NH3, and AOD with sufficient sensitivity to the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere for air quality application. · To cover the major population centers of the tropics and subtropics that will not be observed by the currently planned constellation, observations are needed over the latitude range of 15°N to 35°S and longitude range of 80°W to 75°E.  This is a region of dimensions 50° of latitude by 155° of longitude, requiring two geostationary platforms and international collaboration. · NASA and USAID collaborate on making satellite products available in developing countries under the SERVIR program.  SERVIR should be expanded to include air quality applications.  Summary  The population explosion over the next few decades will primarily impact the tropics and subtropics.   The planned geostationary view of major gaseous pollutants misses many of the tropical and subtropical megacities and near megacities (particularly in South America and Africa).  Emissions and relative source contributions of pollutants affecting air quality in these cities are very poorly known.  Therefore, geostationary instruments focused on the tropics and subtropics are needed.  In addition, there is a need for surface and aircraft measurements to derive today’s baseline emissions and air quality in the fast-growing population centers of the tropical and subtropical developing world.  The impacts of biomass burning and dust on urban air quality, the interactions of pollution with the aerosol-cloud-radiation environment, and long-range transport must be quantified.  Air quality in these regions is closely linked with land-use changes and the hydrological cycle.  Therefore, atmospheric composition measurements in this region should be accomplished in conjunction with studies of land-use change, cloud-aerosol interaction, and greenhouse gas emissions.   In the near-term there is a need for suborbital observations to establish baseline tropical megacity atmospheric composition, sources, and regional impacts in conjunction with ground stations and modeling.  In the longer-term, geostationary satellite observations of atmospheric composition over the tropics and subtropics are needed for reactive gases, aerosols, and longer-lived species such as CO and methane as an aid in predicting severe air quality events, as well as for gaining insight on the diurnal emission patterns and chemical processing occurring in each megacity.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of   basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?     Aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) is recognized by the IPCC as not only one of the main sources  of uncertainty in our knowledge of anthropogenic climate forcing, but also as the key  components in the forcing-feedback mechanisms that affect hydrological cycles, which have a  wide range of impacts on weather, agriculture, air quality, and Earth’s energy balance.     Aerosols and clouds interact in complex ways. Aerosol particles serve as cloud condensation  nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) that affect cloud composition and radiative properties. In  addition, aerosol particles can modify clouds by changing atmospheric heating rates through the  aerosol direct radiative process. Changes in cloud properties also affect precipitation formation  processes, which in turn feed back on cloud dynamics in highly nonlinear ways. Furthermore, the  radiative effect of the aerosol-cloud system is very sensitive to its relative position in the vertical  atmospheric column. For instance, the presence of absorbing aerosols above clouds can  potentially exert strong atmospheric heating, which may lead to longer cloud lifetimes through  the so-called semi-direct effect. On the other hand, clouds affect the formation and evolution of  aerosols. Clouds provide important media for heterogeneous chemistry to transform precursor  gases into secondary inorganic and organic aerosols. Aerosol particle number concentration and  size distribution can be modulated by a variety of mechanisms during cloud processing.  Scavenging of aerosol particles by clouds and precipitation is the most important pathway for  removing aerosols from the atmosphere. These interactions occur on very short time scales (e.g.,  minutes to hours).      Despite many research efforts in the past decades, establishing clear relationships among  aerosols, clouds, and precipitation is still a significant challenge. Such difficulty is in part due  to inadequate observations to account for the large spatial (including vertical) and temporal  inhomogeneity of aerosols and clouds, to distinguish aerosols from clouds (and vice versa), and  to understand the causal relationships in different cloud regimes. It will require new or integrated  observing systems with enhanced capabilities to make substantial progress. The following key  questions should be addressed:        2   ! How does aerosol-cloud interaction change Earth’s climate and environment?  ! What are the radiative and microphysical properties of aerosol and clouds in different   cloud regimes (e.g., marine stratocumulus, trade-wind cumulus, deep convection) and in  different environments (e.g., polluted, fire, dust-influenced, and clean marine)?   ! How do the above-mentioned properties evolve at different spatial and temporal scales,  from the individual cloud scale (few kilometers and tens of minutes) to the cloud life  cycle (tens to few hundred km and few to 24 hours) and the regional scale (few hundred  to thousands of km and few days)?   ! How can we deduce the aerosol-cloud interaction processes in a particular cloud regime  and certain environment from the suite of observations?   ! How can we disentangle the causal relationship between aerosol and clouds from their  common association with large-scale meteorology?     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?     Considering the importance of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate interactions and feedbacks,  especially in a rapidly changing climate, and the slow progress so far on assessing these  interactions, the coming decade should be an era of making break-through progress in addressing  this issue.     In the past decades, remote sensing of aerosols and clouds have been conducted from the low- earth orbiting (LEO) satellites with both passive (including MODIS, VIIRS, MISR, OMI,  PARASOL) and active sensors (CALIOP, CATS on ISS, and CloudSat radar). The passive  sensors have the advantage of extended spatial coverage to retrieve/derive a number of aerosol  and cloud properties, including aerosol optical depth, absorption, particle size and shape; cloud  fraction, optical depth, effective particle radius, cloud top temperature and height. However, they  have no capability to resolve vertical structure of aerosols and clouds, and their aerosol retrievals  are ambiguous in the vicinity of clouds. In contrast, the active sensors measure vertical profiles  of aerosols and clouds with minimal artifacts to make retrieving additional parameters possible  (e.g., aerosol in the vicinity of or above clouds, and cloud droplet concentration), but their small  spatial footprint limits understanding of the stated problems to only a statistical sense.  Fundamentally, the low temporal frequency of polar-orbiting satellite observations impedes  investigation of aerosol-cloud interaction processes, such that the investigation has to be carried  out via a statistical analysis of aerosol-cloud relationships over a monthly or seasonal time scale  when aerosols and clouds have changed significantly. The problem is further complicated by the  tendency that both aerosols and clouds correlate strongly with meteorological conditions that  evolve throughout the day. As a result, the aerosol-cloud relationships from the polar-orbiting  satellites can only be viewed as “association”; no causality mechanisms can be determined from  the once-a-day observations.    A geostationary platform would be ideal to measure time-resolved aerosols and clouds  simultaneously to observe the joint evolution of aerosols and clouds and offer the opportunity of  deducing the causal/feedback processes. For example, the ABI instrument to be onboard the  NOAA GOES-R satellite (to be launched in 2017) has the MODIS-like capability of retrieving  aerosol and cloud properties but with much higher frequency (every 5-15 minutes in regular      3   mode and 30 seconds in a special mesoscale mode). However, it inherits the drawbacks of  passive sensors and also has no capability to measure aerosol-related gas species or aerosol  absorption, which affects atmospheric circulation and cloud lifetime. Although some of these  parameters will be measured by the NASA geostationary mission TEMPO (Tropospheric  Emissions: Monitoring Pollution, expected to be launched by the end of 2010s), the coarse pixel  resolution (2.1x4.7 km), pre-determined geographic coverage (North America), and different  viewing geometry from GOES-R constrain the ability of joint TEMPO+GOES-R approach to  address the stated ACI questions.    To make a significant leap forward in understanding ACI, a dedicated, integrated  observing system should be established. Considering that the ACI is almost certainly  regime dependent, we recommend a focus on cloud regimes (e.g., marine stratocumulus,  trade-wind cumulus, and deep convection) locally and regionally as the first priority in  order to make tractable progress. A core observing system includes:     ! Space-based remote sensing at high temporal frequency (e.g., geostationary satellite) with  sufficient spectral range (UV to IR) and spatial resolution to observe clouds, aerosols and  relevant gases concurrently   ! Arrays of surface networks with active sensors (lidar and radar) to resolve the vertical  structure of aerosol and cloud properties   ! In-situ measurements to provide microphysical and chemical details that cannot be  obtained by remote-sensing     The core observing system emphasizes regime-focused, high spatial and temporal resolution  observations. It embraces the existing remote sensing capabilities but overcomes a number of  deficiencies to enhance the quality and extend the quantity of key parameters regarding ACI.  Table 1 lists the required basic parameters (directly measured, retrieved, or derived).     Table 1. Required basic parameters and possible observation platforms.

Making regime-focused observations also provides best support for fine-scale models (e.g.,  cloud-resolved model, large eddy simulation model) developments and improvements, which can  resolve (rather than empirically approximate) the aerosol-cloud interaction processes. The fine- resolution modeling of regime-specific processes can provide global models with robust  parameters.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/ questions?    Only space-based observations from geostationary platforms can achieve continuous, large-area  coverage many times per day, which is essential for the study described above. No other  platforms are able to meet this fundamental requirement. These regular space-based observations  must also be made as part of an integrated system including in-situ and ground-based remote  sensing observations and modeling systems capable of combining these diverse observations.    North and South Americas and surrounding oceans can be the regions to establish the first  regional observing system, for their diverse aerosol environments (pollution, biomass burning,  transported dust, and marine) and cloud regimes (deep convection, marine stratocumulus, and  trade-wind cumulus), and particularly for logistical feasibility. There are established  infrastructures of ground-based networks over the U.S. and South America (e.g., MPLNET,  AERONET, NOAA networks) that can be expended or reformed to best complement the satellite  observations. Possible study areas include: Offshore California (marine stratocumulus), Gulf of  Mexico (trade-wind cumulus), and Amazonia (deep convection).

The sea surface is a critical link that couples oceanic and atmospheric processes for both weather and climate studies affecting the Earth System. Insufficient knowledge of surface processes at and across the interface and its linkage to subsurface heat and mass balances induces significant errors in the representation of the ocean’s thermal structure and oceanic heat content variations. Global sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface topography missions using sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) are central to improving estimates of the spatial variability of oceanic heat content (OHC) values, which have been shown to be central to weather forecasting (e.g. hurricane intensity forecasting), seasonal to annual variability in these signals (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation , Madden Julian Oscillation), coral reef bleaching at the deeper reefs and more recently fisheries oceanography.    Figure 1: OHC estimate (relative to 26oC: color bar) and geostrophic velocity vectors from space-based measurements of satellite altimetry and sea surface temperatures on 1 Aug 2015 in the IAS.   Evidence exists that OHC (essentially vertically integrated thermal profiles that includes SSTs from the NESDIS SST Product) becomes important in hurricane intensity forecasting in the western parts of ocean basins such as the IntraAmerican Seas (IAS) in the North Atlantic and the Main Development region in the Western Pacific. In the IAS regime (Figure 1), sources of high OHC such as the warm Caribbean Current, Loop Current (LC) and the warm anticyclonic eddy field have provided additional thermal energy to major hurricanes over the past decade (Katrina).  Some of the strongest North Atlantic Ocean basin hurricanes have occurred over the warm pool regime in the IAS (Fig. 2). This variability points to the importance of the OHC on intensity in the IAS. Examination of these hurricanes relative to OHC (Meyers et al., 2014) shows that they often reach maximum intensity over the high-OHC Subtropical Water of the Caribbean Sea, Florida Current, Gulf of Mexico LC, or Gulf Stream. Approximately seventy percent of hurricanes with maximum winds > 120 knots experience eyewall replacement cycles (ERCs) after reaching maximum intensity levels. Hurricanes subsequently weaken due to the combination of ERCs, increasing shear, and movement over the lower-OHC Gulf Common Water (e.g., thin mixed layers) where upwelling and vertical mixing via shear instability cools the SST quickly, reduces OHC, and diminishes enthalpy fluxes.  Hurricanes striking the US Atlantic Eastern Seaboard encounter similarly oceanic environments passing over the Gulf Stream and then cooler shelf waters. Such behavior in hurricanes has become much clearer now that there is an evaluated OHC product available for forecasting.   Figure 2:  Tracks and positions of maximum intensity for fourteen of the strongest hurricanes recorded in HURDAT from 1998-2011, plotted over OHC relative to the 26oC isotherm for Sept 2005 from SMARTS climatology. The deep red color is the “heat reservoir or hurricane gas tank”, depicting the Caribbean warm pool that extends into the Gulf of Mexico via the LC. To improve our ability to resolve the sources and sinks of OHC in all the basins, at least three radar altimeter missions are needed for sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) for daily imaging and to provide a realistic product for mesoscale oceanography. Given that only 17-years of OHC mapping has been done, such applied research efforts must continue over the next decade to build an evaluated data base for weather and climate studies. While the product has been principally used during hurricane (tropical cyclone) seasons in the basins, daily mapping also provides valuable data to address key science questions related to climate such as the extent of warming (or cooling) in the warm pools of the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins, thermodynamic processes in the equatorial wave guides associated with eastward propagating Kelvin Waves (ENSO), and when the Indian ocean basin is completed, linkages to the Madden-Julian Oscillation across the tropics.  We seek to build a global, evaluated Ocean Heat Content suite of products  based on future altimetry missions.    2.       Why are these challenge/questions timely?  Additional space-based missions are on the horizon from late 2015 through 2020 for global SSHA measurements from space that includes newer technologies, as listed in Table 1.  That said, we must ensure that these missions are launched in a timely manner to avoid gaps in the SSHA measurements for these OHC estimations. As noted above OHC is used in forecasting intensity change particularly in the western parts of the ocean basins where the signals are large and have an impact on tropical cyclones. When linked to planned new sensors over the next decade, a more complete picture of the air-sea interface and linkages to the upper ocean structure will lead to improved products for weather and climate, coral reef structure and fisheries oceanography.

Space-based observing techniques are the most effective platform to provide daily updated basin scale measurements of SST, SSHA and OHC variations. The combination of different ground tracks from the various altimetry missions provides the necessary spatial and temporal sampling to produce daily grids of OHC in the various ocean basins.  The NRC also asks that in responding to these questions:  a.       Existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the challenge and associated questions. What additional investments are needed?  Given the import of severe weather forecasting globally across all basins, we must encourage and foster collaborations on these satellite missions as well as building new and enhanced products   globally.  The same can be said for exploiting the climate variations out of the archived data set and products as new insights in global oceanic changes would be potentially addressed with international colleagues.   b.     Linking space-based observations with other observations increases the value of data for addressing scientific questions aimed at societal needs;  The value of these investments is several fold especially when simultaneous spaced-based high-resolution ocean topography are coupled to in-situ measurements such as profiling ARGO floats, APEX floats (electromagnetic for current profiles), long-term ocean moorings (TAO), XBT transects and ocean surveys from various research aircraft (e.g., NOAA WP-3D). The importance of the aircraft surveys is that a large area can be sampled from research aircraft. The in-situ measurements provide a means of assessing the errors on the OHC estimates from spaced-based measurements of SST and SSHA. These additional measurements provide valuable profiles of temperature, salinity and current to link directly the SSHA and SST variability to ocean structure (including the challenge of mapping the surface mixed layer).   In the coastal regime, the linkages to the nation-wide array of high frequency surface current radars and glider technologies will allow one to get OHC even closer to the coast. Thus a more complete picture will emerge of OHC variability for use in basic and applied research as well as operations such as forecasting hurricane intensity change.   c.       Anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and  Anticipated benefits include new understanding of upper ocean thermodynamics, dynamics and air-sea processes relevant to tropical cyclone intensity forecasting, climate variability (e.g., SST anomalies and OHC anomalies over various time scales), fisheries, coral reef bleaching and air-sea fluxes. Over the longer term, the benefits are for climate variability including SST and OHC anomalies across the ocean basins.  d.      Science communities involved.  Relevant science communities include air-sea interaction, physical oceanography including coastal oceanography, severe weather forecasting, climate dynamics, and fisheries oceanography. The altimetric Ocean Surface Topography Science Team is also a relevant community for OHC studies.     Relevant Publications for Oceanic Heat Content:  DeMaria, M. Mainelli M., L.K. Shay, J.A.

A large fraction of the uncertainty in predicting 21st-century climate  change lies in the uncertainties associated with anthropogenic aerosol forcing and  feedbacks that result from land-atmosphere-ocean interactions and interactions between  natural and anthropogenic emissions [IPCC, 2013]. As aerosol effects on climate are  estimated from the differences between model simulations with present-day and with  preindustrial aerosol and precursor emissions, accurate representation of marine aerosols  is critical for assessment of anthropogenic aerosol effects in Earth System Science  models [Ramanathan et al., 2001; Andreae, 2007; Hoose et al., 2009; Ghan et al., 2013;  Carslaw et al., 2013]. Changes in marine ecosystems in response to a wide range of stress  factors caused by human activities can further incite complex feedbacks between ocean  and atmosphere. Reduction in sea ice cover and changes in physical (temperature,  salinity, circulation), chemical (nutrient availability, pH) and biological (bacterial and  phytoplankton abundance) properties of seawater can strongly influence production rate  and physicochemical properties of marine aerosols. These changes in seawater properties  can, in turn, affect the sources, sinks, and properties of marine aerosol, influence  concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INP) in  the atmosphere. Participants in recent sea spray aerosol workshop suggested that there is  a great need for comprehensive observational data on marine aerosols that can be used  for improvement/evaluations of climate models [Meskhidze et al., 2013]. The collection  of such data requires multiscale measurements (from in situ to remote sensing) through a  coordinated and multidisciplinary response, with involvement and expertise from a  broad range of scientific communities (including atmospheric sciences, physical and  biological oceanography).   Responses to the NRC call questions  1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in  the coming decade?  Current Earth System Science models exhibit a large diversity in their representations of  marine aerosol sources and sinks, as well as the processes by which these aerosols impact  cloud water and ice formation. This diversity is due in part to the lack of measurements to  constrain the models. Measurements of marine aerosols are challenging because of their  vast spatiotemporal variability and low concentration. Key questions remain unanswered  regarding the impacts of marine aerosols on clouds and climate, limiting our ability to        2     quantitatively predict how the future climate will respond to continued and increasing  greenhouse-gas and fine-particle emissions.   1.  How much do major classes of marine particles contribute to the CCN and INP  number of the marine boundary layer in different regions and seasons?   2.  How do environmental parameters (surface wind speed (U10), atmospheric  stability), ocean physicochemical properties (sea surface temperature (SST),  salinity, whitecap fraction, Chlorophyll a ([Chl-a]), dissolved and particulate  organic carbon concentration, surface film coverage), biological indicators  (organism type and abundance, physiological stress), and sea ice extent modify the  CCN and INP number over the ocean?   3.  How do changes in ocean-derived CCN and INP abundances affect cloud  microphysical properties and phase?   4.  What are the feedbacks between oceanic emissions, marine aerosols and clouds,  aerosol deposition, and ocean ecosystems? How is humankind changing these  feedbacks?   These questions can be addressed by the development of improved remote sensing  products in combination with recent advances in modeling, remote surface monitoring  and in situ field and laboratory measurements.  2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with  respect to readiness?  This is a timely challenge. The scientific community is currently poised to make  significant advances in understanding marine aerosols, by utilizing recent improvements  in space-based earth observing systems, in combination with current and planned ground- breaking measurements from field campaigns and laboratory studies. Many of the  parameters crucial for improved characterization of marine aerosols can be retrieved by  sampling the top of the atmosphere radiance spectra and polarized radiance spectra for  selected UV, visible and SWIR bands. Moreover, current global climate models have  reached the point where improved assessments of the human impact on climate change  require small changes in model parameters and processes. Because the response of cloud  properties to changes in aerosols is most sensitive when total aerosol and cloud droplet  concentrations are low, remote marine sites that are not heavily influenced by  anthropogenic or continental sources of aerosols can help approximate the pre-industrial  atmosphere and are ideal natural laboratories for understanding marine aerosol-cloud- climate interactions at a fundamental level.  Today, remote sensing technology has matured enough to be at Technology Readiness  Levels (TRL) 4 to 6, providing an increased number of aerosol and ocean ecosystem  parameters with sufficient accuracy to yield meaningful insight into physical processes  involving marine aerosols. The planned Pre-Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE)  mission will provide ocean biological parameters, including phytoplankton functional  type and pigment absorption spectra, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)  absorption, total and phytoplankton carbon concentration, ocean particle size distribution,  and others. However, in order to better characterize forcings and feedbacks between the  ocean biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem function, and aerosols and clouds in  response to anthropogenic change and natural environmental variability, ocean        3     measurements must be supplemented by simultaneous high-resolution, vertically- resolved retrievals of aerosols and ocean sub-surface properties. Such vertically-resolved  information is essential for distinguishing sea spray aerosol from wind-borne terrestrial  aerosols and exploring quantitative links between ocean parameters and marine aerosol  properties. The multi-wavelength high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) with the  capability to measure aerosol backscatter at 3 wavelengths, extinction at 2 wavelengths,  and depolarization at 2 wavelengths and the multi-angle, multi-wavelength polarimeter  planned for the Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystem (ACE) mission can provide vertical profiles of  aerosol type (sea spray, dust, smoke, etc.), extinction, optical thickness, complex index of  refraction, concentration and size, simultaneously with ocean surface wind speed and  sub-surface data products such as the subsurface particulate backscatter coefficient and  depolarization ratio.   3. Why are space-based observations essential to addressing these  challenges/questions?  Satellites are, and will likely remain, the dominant means for improved characterization  of marine aerosols and aerosol-cloud-climate interactions in a changing climate because  they provide global, long-term information on the spatiotemporal variability of many  properties affecting marine aerosol production (i.e., surface wind speed, wave  parameters, surface Chlorophyll a ([Chl-a]), dissolved and particulate organic carbon  concentration, whitecap fraction, SST, and salinity) and removal. There is a number of  past, existing and planned remote sensing instruments supported through U.S. and  international programs that can be used for characterization of marine aerosols, as well  as ground-based systems including the MAN, a ship-borne data acquisition initiative  complementing island-based AERONET measurements, and satellites such as MODIS,  MISR, AATSR, PARASOL, MERIS, SeaWiFS, CALIPSO, GPM, SAGE-III/ISS, CATS,  and PACE. However, none of these sensors can achieve coincident (in time and space)  retrievals of vertically-resolved aerosol information, ocean sub-surface properties, and  ocean biological parameters, i.e., parameters essential for quantitative characterization of  marine aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. Moreover, current satellite sensors either do  not provide the data or provide at signal-to-noise ratio that is not high enough for  retrieval of many ocean ecosystem processes and aerosol speciation and loadings over the  oceans. Existing satellites also provide limited data in the Arctic and Southern Ocean  regions characterized by high cloudiness and low solar zenith angles. Therefore, only the  combination of instrumentation planned for future PACE and ACE missions can provide  the data on global ocean ecology, biogeochemistry, aerosols and clouds, accurate enough  to lead to advances in our understanding of the coupled ocean-aerosol-cloud system.  Additional investments are needed to link space-based observations with other  observations. The supporting satellite measurements are needed to assess environmental  conditions affecting marine aerosols including SST, U10, ice cover, humidity and  temperature profiles and precipitation rates. In particular, measurements of drizzle and  precipitation rates coincident with the lidar and polarimeter observations are required to  better constrain aerosol sinks over the oceans. In addition to the ocean’s physical state,  the chemical composition of the ocean and the sea surface can influence sea spray  production, so direct measurements of surface film coverage (e.g., via synthetic aperture  radar) and biogeochemical variables that have causal links to sea spray production are        4     needed. Improvements in sensor technology can advance the field past using proxies like  [Chl-a] to derive marine chemical state and its impact on aerosol composition.  The detailed mechanisms and the radiative impact of marine aerosols in the Earth's  climate system are best understood through the combination of satellite remote sensing,  in situ observations, and modeling. For example, controlled lab work can provide  detailed insight and help exploring the relevant parameter space with greater clarity and  specificity. Such lab experiments can be used as a tool to illuminate causal relationships  that may lead to better field observations. Dedicated field measurements can range from  in-water physical, chemical, biological, and optical properties, to number size  distribution, chemical characterization, hygroscopicity and CCN and INP properties of  aerosols and precursor trace gas concentration measurements. In addition, field  campaigns will contribute valuable data for calibration and validation of satellite sensors,  as well as provide required data to answer the key challenges and questions for Earth  System Sciences raised in Part 1 of this document.  Improved marine aerosol characterization will have broad societal implications. By  expanding available satellite-borne sensors to encompass retrievals of marine aerosols  and ocean physicochemical/biological systems, it will be possible to capture some  potentially important feedbacks with implications for atmospheric radiative effects and  climate. An improved understanding of these processes means that models will be better  equipped to represent the current state of climate as well as better capture the changes  that have occurred over the past century and predict the changes to climate that would  result from different future emission strategies. The current acidification of the ocean and  its biological adaptation are a response to climate change, which in addition to causing  climate feedbacks through impacts on the CO2 cycle and aerosol emissions, may affect  future fisheries and coastal ecosystem responses. Yet, our current estimations of future  climate effects are based on model approaches where many of the feedback processes are  not included or poorly described. Achieving a high confidence in Earth System Science  models critically depends upon more realistic simulations of the ocean ecosystem-aerosol  interactions with forcings and feedbacks operating on multiple spatiotemporal scales.

NRC’s “​Preparing for Initiation of the 2017­2027 NRC Decadal Survey in Earth Science and  Applications from Space​”. The scope of this paper is in the aspects of the integration of  observations from various satellite platforms as well as integration of satellite and in­situ  platforms for practical global gridded and blended production for supported highest resolutions  and accuracy as possible. The points of this paper are illustrated by two examples. The first  example is a  blended global sea surface wind product by integrating satellite platforms. The 2nd  example is on the integration of satellite and in­situ platforms for climate scale sea surface  temperature purpose.  Recently, the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) commissioned the  Committee on a Framework for Analyzing the Needs for Continuity of NASA­Sustained Remote  Sensing Observations of the Earth from Space. This Committee produced a draft publication on  “Continuity of NASA Earth Observations from Space: A Value Framework”. Our proposed  scope here also fits to this NAS report’s element “2.2 Continuity”, in the sense that “Scientific  understanding of global change requires long­term, reliable measurements of the key physical  variables that define the variability and shifts in state of the Earth system and its multiple  components”, and the Committee’s “Finding: Continuity of an Earth measurement exists when  the quality of the measurement for a specific quantified science objective is maintained over the

uncertainty, repeatability, time and space sampling, and data systems and delivery for climate  variables (algorithms, reprocessing, and availability)—each of which depends on the scientific  objective. ”   The Earth’s weather and climate system is driven by two major constantly changing  components – the atmosphere and the ocean. These two components vigorously interact with  each other over about 70% of the Earth’s surface and these interactions directly regulate the  Earth’s water and energy cycles. Advances in understanding this coupled system and  improvements in numerical weather and ocean forecasts demand increasingly higher resolution   1     data on wind and air­sea fluxes, as documented in several World Meteorological Organization  (WMO) programs (e.g., World Meteorological Organization, 2000; Curry et al., 2004; Large et  al., 1991). Some of the applications require temporal and spatial resolutions of up to 3 hours and  50 km. However, the extent these requirements can be met in reality are constrained by the  existing global observing system of multiple satellites and in­situ observations. Two aspects of  this are: 1) Given the existing observation systems (satellite + in­situ), the resolutions of  product/dataset generation have to be supported by the adequacy of the existing observations, to  reduce aliases and noises by undersampling. 2) In the future design of space­based  observations/satellites, the system design has to take the need of dataset productions for real  world applications into account. Here we illustrate the above by two examples: a) the  multiple­satellite blended sea surface winds; and b) integrated design of satellite and in­situ  observing systems for climate scale sea surface temperature.       2​. Relationship Between Product Resolutions and Available Satellites and Their Orbit  Configurations: Global Blended Sea Surface Wind Example   Sea surface wind speed has been operationally observed from satellite sensors, starting  with a US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite F08 in July 1987 to the  constellation of 5 or more US satellites since 2000. In this satellite era, in­situ observations still  play a critical role in calibrating and validating satellite observations. However, with the dense  satellite sampling, in­situ observations play a minor role in reducing random and sampling errors  in blended analyses using in­situ and satellite observations. Thus in this data sampling example,  we only consider satellite observations.   Among these satellites are the passive DMSP observations from the microwave  radiometers on the Special Sensor Microwave Imager. Later additions to these passive  microwave observations are the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave  Imager (TMI) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of NASA’s Earth Observing  System. The scatterometer (e.g., the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT)), which is active by  nature, uses microwave radar and retrieves both wind speed and wind direction.    2       Fig.1: An example of a simplified view looking down at the North Pole of the satellite observations in   Local Solar Time (LST) of January 2005. Solid lines and arrows indicate ascending tracks and dashed lines  and open arrows indicate descending tracks.     Here we show the temporal improvement of the composite global data sampling rate   from the above satellites (Zhang et al. 2006). We show the possibility of producing blended  global products on a 0.25 global grid for various temporal resolutions. This 0.25 spatial grid  marginally resolves ocean boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream where large turbulent  fluxes and large flux gradients frequently occur   Table 1. Typical percentages of the global 0.25º oceanic boxes between 65ºS – 65ºN in which there are  data coverage 75% of the time or better for the specified time resolutions (1​st​ column) and as functions of time  (indicated by the top row).  The whole time period is classified into six stages corresponding to the typical  number of available satellites. The time periods with ≥ 90% spatial coverage and ≥75% temporal coverage  are highlighted by yellow shading.        3     From the above, we re­emphasize two points: 1) Given the existing observation systems  (satellite + in­situ), the resolutions of product/dataset generation have to be supported by the  adequacy of the existing observations, to reduce aliases and noises by undersampling. 2) In the  future design of space­based observations/satellites, the system design has to take the need of  dataset productions for real world applications into account.     3. Integration of Satellite and In­Situ Observations: Sea Surface Temperature Example for  Global Climate Monitoring and Research   The WMO Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) consists of several components,  including strategic planning, system design and implementation, and effective data integration  and dissemination. Efficient management of sustained observing system operations requires  continuous monitoring, evaluation, and periodic reviews.   Climate change indicators include oceanic and atmospheric temperature variability at  timescales longer than weather­related fluctuations (typically less than a week). Temperature  changes at the Earth’s surface (over both land and ocean) have been the prominent indicators in  many climate change assessments because surface observations have the longest records and thus  provide a historical context for climate change. In this paper, the term “climate assessment”  refers to climate trends and variability from observational data, but it does not include attribution  of the causes of climate change (Zhang et al., 2009).   The modern SST observing system mainly consists of in situ observations (from ships  and buoys) and satellite remote sensing. Since the satellite instruments became operational in  1981, satellite observations have provided dramatically improved coverage in time and space.  The increased data coverage assures adequately small analysis errors in objectively analyzed  SST fields by blending satellite and in situ observations. However, adequate in situ observations  are still needed to correct systematic biases associated with satellite retrieval algorithms. These  biases occur for both infrared and microwave retrievals. Infrared retrievals are impacted by cloud  and aerosol contamination, while microwave retrievals are impacted by precipitation and land  contamination.    4       Fig.2: Potential satellite bias reduction versus needed in­situ data/buoy data density.     One study for AVHRR SST used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the relationship   between the residual satellite bias and in situ data density, as shown in Fig. 2. It shows the  near­exponential bias reductions as the BD increases from zero. Rapid error reductions occur  when the BD increases from 0 to a BD between 2 and 5; further increase in the BD only results  in minimal reductions in the PSBE. Coincidently, a BD of 2 reduces the maximum bias from 2°C  (at BD = 0) to about 0.5°C, which is the upper limit of the GCOS/GOOS requirement. Thus, a  BD of 2 is regarded as the minimum acceptable density.    The above observing system has been operationally implemented as US/NOAA’s  contribution to GCOS. However, the above only used AVHRR satellite observations. If two  types of satellite instruments are present with independent error characteristics (e.g., infrared and  microwave), the PSBE error could be reduced. In addition to the operational AVHRR SST  observations since the early 1980s, microwave observations became available between 38°S and  38°N from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Tropical Rainfall  Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) beginning in December 1997 and   5     globally from NASA’s Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) beginning in June  2002. Other global microwave satellite SST instruments before 2002 were either poorly  calibrated or lacked the low­frequency channels that were needed by the SST retrieval algorithm  [e.g., the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)]. Additional microwave SST instruments  have recently become available and more are planned, as well as more recent improved VIIRS  observations. Therefore there is a need to reevaluate the above integrated Situ­Satellite observing  systems.     References:

Santer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming  decade?  Projection of future changes in climate due to the accumulation of anthropogenic gases and aerosols in  the atmosphere is one of the grand challenges of the Earth science community.  These projections are  typically made with sophisticated computer models of the general circulation of the coupled  atmosphere-ocean system. The ability of such models to capture key features of the present-day and  historical climate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for enhancing confidence in the reliability of  model projections of 21st century climate change. To perform meaningful model evaluation studies, the  best possible measurements of the climate system over the longest possible period are required.   Temperature is the fundamental climate variable most directly affected by the accumulation of  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and has significant impacts on many different aspects of human  society and ecosystems.  Ensuring a continuous record of temperature is critical to characterizing our  changing climate, and enabling climate model evaluation.      2. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?  The temperature at Earth’s surface is well represented by in situ measurements, with records dating  back more than a century.  In contrast, systematic measurements of the “upper air” temperature above  Earth’s surface only began in the last 70 years.  Beginning in the late 1940s, measurements of  atmospheric temperature were made from a sparse but expanding network of radiosonde (weather  balloon) launch stations.  The limited coverage of this network, particularly over the oceans, makes  analyses of global-scale changes difficult or impossible.  Starting in late 1978, the coverage problem was  solved by the advent of microwave sounders. These satellite-based instruments continuously monitor  atmospheric temperature with near-global coverage.  Satellite temperature measurements remain a  crucial resource for tracking global-scale changes in the temperature of planet Earth, for separating an  anthropogenic signal from natural variability [e.g. Santer et al., 2013], and for evaluating climate models.         Unfortunately, the satellite sounder record is plagued with its own inhomogeneities.  These include  calibration drifts and instrument non-linearity, drifts due to changing local measurement time (diurnal  cycle drifts), and uncertainty associated with the measurement frequency changes that occurred with  crossover from the last MSU instrument (NOAA-14) to the first AMSU Instruments (NOAA-15, AQUA,  and NOAA-16).  Over time, our understanding of these problems has improved, but the issues are still  far from settled, largely due to the complex interplay between the individual problems described above.     The largest source of uncertainty is in the adjustments made to account for changing measurement  time. This uncertainty arises from uncertain estimates of the diurnal cycle in the troposphere and (for  tropospheric channels) of the microwave emissions from Earth’s surface [Mears et al., 2011]. Current  versions of the sounder-based datasets account for the diurnal cycle by either using diurnal cycles  deduced from model output (with well-documented flaws) or by attempting to derive diurnal cycle from  the satellite measurements themselves (an approach plagued by sampling issues and possible  calibration drifts).  Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses, but neither has sufficient  accuracy to construct an unassailable long-term record of atmospheric temperature change.   A second issue is uncertainty due to the change in measurement frequencies that occurred with the  transition from MSU to AMSU.  The channels used for tropospheric measurements (MSU channel and  AMSU channel 5) are significantly different between the two satellites.  The same applies to the  channels employed for lower stratospheric measurements (MSU Channel 4 and AMSU channel 9).  Because the last MSU and the early AMSU satellites made measurements at different local times, it is  difficult to obtain absolute intercalibration of these instruments without more accurate knowledge of  the diurnal cycle at each frequency.   Different research groups have employed different strategies for addressing these uncertainties,  resulting in an ongoing controversy regarding the size and spatial structure of long-term trends in  tropospheric temperature [Thorne et al., 2011].  Our goal is to design a mission to improve the accuracy  of adjustments for non-climatic artifacts in satellite temperature retrievals. A successful mission will  have two important outcomes.  The first outcome is the continuation of an accurate temperature record  into the future.  The second key outcome is that the results from our proposed mission will greatly  improve the cross-calibration of the previous MSU, AMSU, and ATMS instruments, thus reducing the  observational uncertainty in estimates of the changes in upper air temperature since late 1978.   The long-term trends in global middle tropospheric temperature estimated by different groups are in  the range 0.05 to 0.15 K/decade, with an estimated uncertainty in the Remote Sensing Systems dataset  of 0.042 K/decade.  For a typical satellite, the effect of the diurnal cycle leads to a drift of approximately  0.1K over its lifetime.  Over the land, current model based diurnal adjustments appear to remove about  ½ of this drift, leaving about 0.05K of residual drift.  Over the ocean, the diurnal drift is at least 5 times  smaller, but its structure is largely unconstrained by current observations.  If the residual drift for both  land and ocean is reduced to 0.01K, the effect of the diurnal drift would no longer dominate the  uncertainty.  For our proposed mission to measure the diurnal cycle, the dominant source of error is  aliasing of daily to monthly scale variability into the derived diurnal cycle.  Simulation studies     demonstrate that this can be minimized by using two intercalibrated satellites making measurements 4  times per day.      3. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?  Recent technology advances in miniature radiometers, ultra-stable calibration assemblies, and  dedicated launches for relatively small payloads now enable a new class of relatively inexpensive small  satellites that can now be launched into optimum orbits to make measurements of the diurnal cycle of  upper-air temperature feasible.  Our simulations show that two single-instrument microwave satellites  in high-inclination and relatively rapidly precessing (instead of slowly precessing) orbits, combined with  measurements from existing and planned weather-satellite instruments, could provide both global  coverage and accurate diurnal cycle sampling to meet critical climate requirements that are currently  unaddressed, as elaborated above.   With channels duplicating the small number of MSU and AMSU  channels that are used for climate trends, the uncertainty associated with surface emission could be  significantly reduced.

The ocean is a fundamental component of the Earth’s climate system. It supports productive   fisheries that are essential to the global economy, and bears an increasing burden of human  impacts, including pollutants associated with offshore resource extraction and, in coastal regions,  high-density economic development and at-sea activity.  In all of these contexts and more, the  role of the near-surface ocean is paramount: it supports the exchange of heat and dissolved gases  with the atmosphere, it supplies the primary biological productivity that drives fishery  ecosystems, and it determines the spread and fate of surface pollutants.  The vertical exchange of  fluid and materials between the near-surface (the uppermost 10-100 m of the water column) and  the deeper ocean, especially the systematic upwelling of nutrient-rich deeper waters into the  upper ocean, strongly affects the properties and dynamics of the near-surface ocean and upper  ocean ecosystems. Model-based assessments of near-surface/deep ocean vertical transports vary  widely, in part because they rely on relatively sparse measurements relative to the appropriate  space and time scales.    Progress in quantifying and understanding these vertical exchanges and the ocean’s role in  these broader contexts has long been restrained by the technical challenges associated with  obtaining systematic global observations of the ocean’s near-surface vertical motion field. The  main impediment has been the smallness of vertical velocities relative to horizontal velocities,  which scales like the vertical-to-horizontal aspect ratio of the flow.  The challenge of this  mismatch in scales is compounded by the fact that these flows are nearly in geostrophic balance,  which implies a horizontal velocity field that is nearly nondivergent (i.e., there is minimal net  horizontal inflow and outflow) which further reduces typical vertical velocities below the simple  aspect-ratio estimate.  Typical magnitudes of ocean upwelling velocities on horizontal scales on  the order of 50 km and larger are believed to be approximately 10-4 cm/s, or less than 1 m/day.  This speed is far too small to measure directly and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable  future based on the fact that the measurement accuracy of the best current meters when deployed  in the field (about 1 cm/s) has remained the same for the past few decades (Hogg and Frye,  2007), and yet is inadequate by orders of magnitude for this task.    Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?     We need systematic global observations to understand the ocean’s near-surface vertical  motion from the large scale through the mesoscale and into the submesoscale, which can be  characterized as wavelength scales smaller than about 50 km.  With recent advances in  instrument design (e.g., Doppler scatterometry; see Bourassa et al. Winds and Currents response),  this can be accomplished using two complementary methods to make independent estimates of  the vertical motion field based separately on measurements of: 1) the surface ocean horizontal  velocity divergence field and 2) the surface wind stress and surface ocean horizontal current  vorticity.  The first method allows the direct inference of near-surface vertical motion from the     horizontal divergence at the sea surface.  This near-surface vertical motion includes both internal  dynamical and wind-driven components, and its inferred amplitude depends on the depth at  which the estimate is made.    An important requirement for measurements of surface currents is that the divergent surface  horizontal velocity that gives rise to near-surface upwelling is ageostrophic, meaning it does not  assume a balance between currents and pressure or, in this application, sea surface height.   Ageostrophic currents cannot be inferred from measurements of sea-surface height by satellite  altimetry, including the future Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. Such  measurements require an altogether new satellite technology. Moreover, in order to distinguish  the vertical velocity from internal dynamics from wind-driven vertical velocity, winds and  ageostrophic currents must be measured simultaneously. The wind-driven component of near- surface vertical velocity is inferred indirectly through well-established theoretical extensions  (Stern 1965; Gaube et al. 2015) of classical Ekman-layer theory (Ekman 1905; Gill, 1982;  Pedlosky 1987), which does not depend on estimates of boundary-layer depth.  A Doppler  scatterometer mission will provide global estimates of the total and the wind-driven vertical  velocity fields over the full continuum, from ocean basin scales down to the smallest spatial and  temporal scales that can be resolved within the limitations of the error characteristics of the  surface velocity measurements.     The mathematical formulations for the two aspects of vertical velocity that can be measured  by a Doppler scatterometer are as follows. The total vertical velocity is estimated from the  divergence of the total surface velocity by integrating vertically downward to the base of the  Ekman layer, on the order of 10 m. The wind-driven vertical velocity in the open ocean is  traditionally determined from the ratio of the vector wind stress τ  to the Coriolis parameter f by  wEk=ρ–1∇×(τ /f), where ρ is the water density. The stress in this equation is determined from the  relative wind, i.e., the difference between the vector wind and the surface current velocity. On  scales smaller than a few hundred kilometers, the classical formula above for Ekman pumping  excludes the most important contribution to wind-driven upwelling. With assumptions of small  Rossby number (i.e., the relative vorticity ζ<<f ), Stern (1965) showed that the planetary  vorticity f in the denominator of the classical expression for Ekman pumping should be replaced  with the absolute vorticity (f+ζ). This adds a contribution to Ekman pumping that arises from the  interaction of the wind stress with horizontal variations of the relative vorticity of the surface  currents. The total wind-driven vertical velocity is then wSE=wEk+wζ, where                   wζ = (ρf 2) –1 (τx ∂ζ/∂y – τy ∂ζ/∂x).      Here τx and τy are the eastward and northward components of the wind stress. With sufficiently  accurate measurements of surface velocity, the combined measurements of surface winds and  currents from a Doppler scatterometer will be ideally suited to estimation of wζ. The scale  limitation of Stern-Ekman theory is not yet known, but the theory likely applies at least down to  wavelength scales of 50 km.   On oceanic mesoscales, Gaube et al. (2015) showed that Ekman pumping from small-scale  features in the wind field is generally negligible compared with wζ. They further showed that the  magnitude of wζ increases rapidly with decreasing scale down to the ~200 km wavelength  resolution limit of presently available satellite data (corresponding to an eddy radius of ~40 km).    To provide context for the importance of satellite estimates of wζ on mesoscales and  submesoscales, long-term mean wind-induced vertical velocities (classical Ekman-pumping) at     mid-latitudes on the ocean basin scale that arise from Ekman convergence between the tropical  easterlies and mid-latitude westerlies and control the circulation and structure of the ocean’s  subtropical gyres, are of order 30 m/year or 0.1 m/day (Risien and Chelton 2008).  The  systematic effects of ocean surface currents on wind-driven vertical motion inferred for  mesoscale eddies from feature-based compositing are of this same order in the global mean, and  up to several times larger in regional means (Gaube et al. 2015).  These composite estimates  were constructed over thousands of realizations based on the relatively low-resolution winds and  surface currents that are presently available (wavelength scales of about 200 km). Locally,  instantaneous vertical velocities at mesoscales can be much larger. For example, in situ tracer  measurements in a case-study of a mesoscale eddy in the subtropical North Atlantic  (McGillicuddy et al. 2007) measured upwelling velocities as large as 0.4 m/day.  It is likely that  upwelling velocities often exceed 1 m/day in association with large-amplitude mesoscale eddies.  Primitive equation model simulations suggest that submesoscale upwelling velocities often  exceed 10 m/day (e.g, Ponte et al. 2013).    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?     Present model-based assessments of vertical velocity vary widely, in part because they rely on  relatively sparse measurements at the appropriate space and time scales. The unique capability of  a Doppler scatterometer that will allow simultaneous direct measurement of ocean surface  currents and measurements of surface winds will provide a new and powerful approach that  facilitates: 1) systematic measurements of surface horizontal current divergence, 2) global study  of the surface current interaction with surface winds, and 3) study of the combined influence of  the divergence and coupled wind and current variability on the near-surface vertical motion field.   These mesoscale and submesoscale vertical motions are expected to be of great importance for  ocean dynamics as well as ocean biology and chemistry (Levy et al., 2001). Additionally, the  expected high-resolution capabilities of a Doppler scatterometer will allow extension of these  measurements into the scientifically and economically important coastal zone, in which  orographic (land topography) and ocean dynamical effects combine to produce rich and energetic  mesoscale and submesoscale surface wind and ocean vertical motion fields.

  Atlas   and   Emmitt,    2008)   have   shown   the   importance   of   accurately   representing   the   interaction   of   the   storm’s   circulation    with   its   environment.   The   difficulty   in   forecasting   tropical   cyclone   intensity   relates   to   the   complex    kinematic   (e.g.,   via   vertical   wind   shear)   and   thermodynamic   (e.g.,   via   moisture   exchange)   interaction    between   the   surrounding   environment   and   the   storm,   the   air-­‐sea   fluxes   beneath   the   storm   and   the    impact   of   atmospheric   aerosols   on   tropical   convection.   Due   to   the   large-­‐scale   coverage   and   altitude-­‐ resolved   data   products,   a   space-­‐based   DWL   is   an   ideal   observing   system   for   providing   wind   profiles   in    the   clear-­‐air   environment   outside   of   the   cyclone,   thus   improving   knowledge   of   the   large   scale    environment,      critical   to   making   accurate   tropical   cyclone   track   and   intensity   forecasts.          Beyond   providing   a   wealth   of   new   wind   data,   a   space-­‐based   DWL   will   improve   atmospheric   motion    vectors   (AMVs)   computed   using   passive   techniques   by   accurately   specifying   the   height   of   AMVs,   their    greatest   source   of   error   (Folger   and   Weissmann   2014;      Di   Michele   et   al.   2013),   and   by   validating   their    velocity   estimates.           0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  Conventional-wind Conventional-mass Satellite-wind Satellite-mass  O bs  er va  tio n   Im pa  ct  %  Total per OBS    3        Accurate,   altitude-­‐resolved   measurements   of   the   global   wind   field   will   also   support   major   advances   in    the   understanding   of   several   key   climate   change   issues.      The   most   comprehensive   tool   available   to    analyze   climatic   trends   is   the   reanalysis   technique   (Uppala   et   al.   2005;   Simmons   et   al.   2010).   An    intercomparison   of   first-­‐generation   reanalyses   (Kistler   et   al.   2001,   not   shown   here)   clearly   demonstrated    that   even   a   basic   quantity   such   as   zonally   averaged,   time-­‐mean   zonal   winds   is   not   well   constrained   by    the   present   observing   system.   In   the   tropical   upper   troposphere   and   the   lower   stratosphere,   the    difference   between   zonal   winds   obtained   from   independent   reanalysis   efforts   is   of   the   same   order   as    the   characteristic   time   variability   of   this   quantity.   This   does   not   necessarily   imply   that   the   reanalysis    technique   is   inadequate   but   rather   points   to   the   fact   that   additional   wind   information   is   needed   to   make    reanalyses   more   consistent.      More   recent   reanalysis   results   still   show   the   same   features.   For   example,    Fig.   2   shows   the   zonal   wind   difference   between   the   most   recent   reanalysis   from   ECMWF   Re-­‐Analysis    (ERA-­‐Interim;   see   Simmons   et   al.   2010;   Dee   et   al.   2011)   and   the   second-­‐generation   40-­‐year   ECMWF   Re-­‐ Analysis   (ERA-­‐40;   Uppala   et   al.   2005)   for   the   overlapping      time   period   1989–2001.   The   differences   are    smaller   than   with   Kistler   et   al.   (2001)   but   the   same   spatial   pattern   is   found.           Fig.   2.   Shown   is   the   zonally   averaged   latitude–height   cross   section   of   zonal   mean   wind   differences       (m   s-­‐1)   between   ERA-­‐40   and   ERA-­‐Interim   for   the   time   period   1989–2001.          4        2.   Why   are   these   challenge/questions   timely   to   address   now   especially   with   respect   to   readiness?       Recent   technology   advances   that   include   improved   structural   materials,   higher   laser   efficiency   and    output   power,   and   more   robust   optical   coatings,   have   allowed   Doppler   lidar   technology   to   reach   a    maturity   level   needed   to   make   the   required   wind   measurements   from   space   (Baker   et   al.   2014).   NASA    has   invested   in   various   DWL   technology   approaches   including:   1)   coherent   detection   (Kavaya   et   al.    2014);   2)   direct   detection   with   Fabry-­‐Perot   (FP)   etalons   (Gentry   et   al.   2000;   ESA   2008;   Reitebuch   et   al.    2009;   Dong   et   al.   2010);   3)   direct   detection   using   a   modified   Mach-­‐Zehnder   interferometer   (Grund   and    Tucker   2011;   Bruneau   et   al.   2013),   and   4)   single-­‐wavelength   full   direct   detection   (ESA   2008;   LeRille   et   al.    2012;   Reitebuch   2012).   ESA’s   Aeolus   mission   (ESA   2008;   Endemann   2006;   LeRille   et   al.   2012)   uses   the    latter   approach,   featuring   a   double-­‐edge   FP   etalon   for   the   molecular   returns   and   a   fringe-­‐imaging   Fizeau    spectrometer   for   the   aerosol   returns.   The   Aeolus   development   effort   has   significantly   reduced   the   risk    for   a   future   winds   mission   by   addressing   many   technical   and   theoretical   challenges   associated   with    space-­‐based   wind   measurements,   as   well   as   demonstrating   instrument   performance   during   a   series   of    airborne   campaigns   (e.g.,   Marksteiner   et   al.   2011;   Reitebuch   et   al.   2013).   Most   recently   a   joint   airborne    campaign   sponsored   by   NASA,   ESA,   and   DLR   was   performed   with   four   wind   lidars   on   two   aircraft   –   the    NASA   DC-­‐8   and   the   DLR   Falcon   –   in   May   2015   with   coordinated   flights   over   the   North   Atlantic,    Greenland   and   Iceland   in   preparation   for   Aeolus   validation   and   supporting   PolarWinds   objectives    (Emmitt   et   al.   2014).          Moreover,   since   the   NRC   (2007)   report,   there   have   been   several   other   airborne   demonstrations   of    various   DWL   approaches   (Weissmann   et   al.   2012;   Pu,   Zhang,   and   Emmitt   2010;   Kavaya   et   al.   2014;    Reitebuch   et   al.   2013;   Tucker   et   al.   2015).   In   addition,   numerous   technical   problems   such   as   laser    damage   for   the   355   nm   UV   wavelength   have   been   addressed   during   Aeolus   development   (see    references   above).      Perhaps   most   importantly,   the   CALIPSO   atmospheric   aerosol   lidar   mission   (Winker   et    al.   2010),   is   currently   over   nine   years   into   its   three   year   mission   (on   orbit   operations   since   2006),    demonstrating   that   laser   lifetime,   reliability   and   system   performance   are   possible   for   space-­‐based   lidar    systems.   Furthermore,   CALIPSO   measures   range-­‐resolved   aerosols   and   clouds   and   calibrates   on   each    orbit   using   molecular   return,   providing   a   measurement   demonstration   of   the   signals   underlying   a    combined   DWL   molecular/aerosol   DWL   approach.             In   a   previous   input   to   the   NRC   (Hardesty   2005),   we   advocated   a   hybrid   DWL   approach   which   utilized   a    coherent   detection   lidar   for   wind   measurements   in   the   low-­‐to-­‐mid   troposphere   and   a   direct   detection    lidar   to   sample   the   upper   troposphere   and   lower   stratosphere.   Subsequent   analysis   at   the   NASA/GSFC    Instrument   Design   Laboratory   showed   that,   while   providing   full   tropospheric   coverage,   an   approach    requiring   two   different   lasers   and   two   different   receivers   carries   substantial   risk   and,   therefore,   high    cost.      New,   technologically-­‐feasible,   single-­‐laser   DWL   mission   approaches   with   potentially   high   science    impact   include   a   coherent   lidar   aerosol/cloud   focused-­‐mission   (Kavaya   et   al.   2014),   an   Aeolus-­‐type    mission   (see   above),   and   an   Optical   Autocovariance   Wind   Lidar   (OAWL)   type   receiver   for   aerosol   or    molecular   returns   (Grund   and   Tucker   2011;   Bruneau   et   al.   2013).   The   technology   in   each   of   these    approaches   has   matured   in   recent   years   and   DWL   mission   designs   are   simpler   today   than   a   decade   ago    which   is   critical   to   reducing   complexity   which,   in   turn,   drives   risk   and,   therefore,   cost.       3.   Why   are   space-­‐based   observations   fundamental   to   addressing   these   challenges/questions?       As   noted   in   NASA’s   2014   Science   Plan   (NASA   2014),   from   space   we   can   observe   and   track   changes   on   a    global   scale,   connecting   causes   to   effects,   and   we   can   study   regional   changes   in   their   global   context.   The    challenges   discussed   above   clearly   require   global   wind   measurements   provided   by   at   least   one   DWL   in       5        LEO.   Accurately   depicting   the   environmental   steering   currents   for   major   land-­‐falling   hurricanes,   for    example,   can   only   be   done   from   space.       ESA’s   Aeolus   mission,   expected   to   launch   in   mid-­‐2017,   will   deploy   the   first   space-­‐based   DWL   with   an    expected   lifetime   of   three   years.   The   resulting   data   will   enable   the   science   community   to   gain   valuable    experience   in   assimilating   DWL   measurements   in   conjunction   with   other   conventional   and   space-­‐based    measurements   for   weather   forecasting,   climate   studies,   and   other   applications.      At   this   time,   however,    ESA   has   no   plans   for   a   follow-­‐on   DWL   mission.      It   is   imperative   that   the   U.S.   take   advantage   of   its    investments   in   DWL   technology   and   the   investments   and   experience   from   the   ADM-­‐Aeolus   mission   to    deploy   a   U.S.   spaced-­‐based   DWL   as   soon   as   possible   in   order   to   provide   the   Nation   with   the   benefits    discussed   above.   Prior   to   such   a   space   mission,   it   is   also   important   to   continue   investing   in   the    improvement   and   demonstration   of   space-­‐ready   technology,   especially   in   the   areas   of   component    space-­‐qualification,   airborne   deployment   and   demonstration,   and   data   analysis   and   assimilation.                   (Please   note:      References   are   available   on   request.)      ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"robert atlas::vijay tallapragada::"}

We currently lack effective means for accurately tracking snow, but recent developments in 4 areas, if integrated into a seamless system, could deliver snow depth and snow water equivalent data at local to global scales, benefiting billions of people.   1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? A key challenge in Earth System Science is quantifying the amount of snow that blankets Earth’s surface each winter as well as how that amount is changing spatially and temporally. Snow is critically important to human welfare, affecting business, food security, power generation, recreation, and climate. More than 25% of terrestrial Earth is snow-covered more than four months each year. But that fraction underestimates snow’s overall importance, because so many towns and agricultural areas lie in snow-free lowlands adjacent to mountains and rely on mountain snowmelt for their water supplies. Current estimates suggest 1/6th of the world’s population relies on snow for agricultural, industrial, and consumptive use. Snow blankets a further 13 million km2 of Arctic sea ice and 15 million km2 of Antarctic sea ice, controlling the thermodynamic growth of the ice and to a large extent the fate of the ice and its interactions with the rest of the climate system.  Despite the obvious importance of snow, we currently lack effective means for accurately tracking global, regional, and even local snow resources. We now find ourselves faced with needing to predict future snow conditions and snowmelt runoff without a reliable estimate of current snow resources. Our operational numerical prediction systems are also hampered by limits in our ability to monitor snow. These systems ingest satellite measurements of snow cover that have poorly-constrained errors, degrading weather and hydrological forecasts. Snow is the only component of the water cycle for which there has not been, or is there planned, a satellite mission. Poor real-time monitoring capabilities exist at a time when we have worrying indications that the amount and timing of snow accumulation and melt are changing, in some cases at rapid rates. Changes in either snow amount or timing will have major ramifications: changing amounts will affect snowmelt-dominated water resources, the growth and melt of sea ice, glacier mass balance, and the thermal state of permafrost. Changing timing, particularly that of the spring freshet, will alter how much of the melting snow can be utilized by people, as well as the overall impact of snow on the global climate through changes in the surface energy balance.  Four interacting trends make predicting future snow cover conditions challenging. One is the intensification of the water cycle, which is altering patterns of precipitation, including snowfall. A second is the rising trend in global temperatures, which is pushing seasonal zero-degree isotherms toward higher elevations and latitudes, altering the boundary between liquid and solid precipitation. This trend is altering snow cover build-up and therefore stream runoff: snow storage is actually the largest seasonally-varying storage term in the global water budget. A third trend is the shift in the delivery of snowmelt water, driven by the earlier arrival of above-freezing air temperatures in spring. In many instances, meltwater, formerly stored as snowpack until runoff in the summer dry season, is likely to run-off to the ocean because of insufficient reservoir capacity downstream. Fourth and finally, the changing snow cover itself, and the period it lies on the ground, is altering the overall climate through feedback processes related to albedo, soil temperature, and sea-ice melt.  Estimates suggest snow cover alone is responsible for -5 to -2 Watts m-2 of cooling across the globe, an effect that has already declined more than 10% due to reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. It is essential that we be able to monitor what is happening to the snow cover. The current state of the science is that we are able, with reasonable skill and resolution, to determine where the snow is, but not how much there is. This problem – the problem of determining the snow water equivalent (SWE) – was identified as a critical need more than 35 years ago, yet remains a key unanswered challenge today. Solving the problem of accurately and reliably determining how much snow (SWE) there is, and how and why it is changing now and in the future, requires both basic and applied research. Any improvement in our knowledge and understanding of snow and snow-related processes will have a positive and immediate impact on billions of people and economic benefits worth billions of dollars.   2)  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? Significant progress has been made in four areas that now make it possible to monitor SWE and snow depth. First, airborne lidar has become a proven tool for measuring snow depth with high accuracy and resolution at the basin scale. Second, significant progress has been made in understanding the interaction of radar with the snow cover, with preliminary algorithms for converting microwave radar signals into SWE already developed. Third, there have been major improvements in physically based snow modeling, and fourth, techniques for sophisticated data assimilation are now available that can be used to ingest remote sensing data into a modeling system. By integrating these four components into a seamless system, local to global snow monitoring would be possible. Recent efforts show that we can now map snow depth to ±10 cm using airborne lidar. Subtracting snow-free elevation maps from maps with snow-cover produces spatially explicit, high-resolution snow-depth measurements. When combined with observations or model estimates of snow density, spatially distributed SWE (±3 cm) values are achieved. Moreover, the NASA/JPL Airborne Snow Observatory has demonstrated that airborne lidar measurements can be made on operational time scales, enabling new, more precise water management operations that are resilient to changing hydroclimatic conditions. Existing sensors and rapid technological development present a clear pathway to implement lidar on high altitude aircraft and perhaps orbital platforms, expanding full-watershed lidar snow depth mapping to the regional and global scale. Thirty-five years of research in using microwave radar to measure SWE is now bearing fruit. Radar has always been an attractive instrument for a snow satellite mission because of its relative insensitivity to clouds, wide swath, and moderate to high spatial and temporal resolution. Improved physical scattering models, as well as extensive analysis of quantitative field observations, explain much of radar’s sensitivities to parameters other than SWE (like snow grain size). Despite these difficulties, significant functional relationships between SWE and backscatter remain and can be utilized for SWE retrievals. Two approaches appear viable: 1) using radar returns with ancillary data on snow grain size or depth to constrain the SWE inversions, or 2) estimating SWE change between two passes using radar phase differences at L-band, capitalizing on the linear density-dielectric relationship. An additional advantage of radar is that snow mission concept studies are presently underway at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); these efforts leverage the extensive progress made on X- and Ku-band radar retrievals done as part of the ESA CoReH20 project, which completed Phase A at ESA, although was not chosen for an ESA mission.  Snow modeling has evolved from a collection of disconnected models that seldom agreed, to the point where we now have modular systems that can integrate different representations of physical processes. This collection of tools now provides insight into how any given model parameter will impact model output, providing capabilities to improve model fidelity and better characterize uncertainty. At the same time, systems for distributing process-based snow models across space and time have advanced. These models include meteorological downscaling, snowdrift development, the ability to force models with lidar measurements, as well modeling snow microstructure to guide microwave remote sensing. By capitalizing on continually increasing computer power, specifically cloud computing and model sharing facilitated by high-speed internet connections, the snow community is ready to: 1) ingest remote sensing measurements at high resolution, 2) combine these observations using models that are based on physical processes, and 3) provide temporal/spatial snow map products that build on remote sensing results, fill in data gaps, and provide snow information that cannot be monitored in any other way.  Similar progress has been made in developing data assimilation procedures for snow. Simplified snow assimilation methods have given way to more optimal systems in both research and operational settings. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) allows us to apply modern computing capabilities to the problem of merging physically based models with remote sensing and in-situ measurements, including the ability to handle multi-scale observations. One advantage of these data assimilation methods is that they propagate information from one (observed) variable to other model variables or locations. Furthermore, the EnKF, and more advanced particle filter approaches, explicitly enable accounting for the sources of uncertainty in the modeling-assimilation system via generation of probabilistic forcing. Radiance-based assimilation techniques, which allow coupling of microwave emission models to traditional snow mass and energy models, now allow inference of snow properties using microwave measurements and snow models, including snow stratigraphy.   3) Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? Forty-five million km2 of Earth’s surface[footnoteRef:1] is heavily impacted, or even dominated, by snow cover. Many of the snow-covered regions of Earth are sparsely populated. Hence they have a very limited (and insufficient) network of ground stations that measure snow. In other more populated regions (like those in and around the Rocky Mountains and the Himalaya), the snow that people rely on for water is stockpiled high in the mountains in rugged and inaccessible terrain. In most locations, the snow cover is extremely heterogeneous, making spot measurements unrepresentative and of limited value. In short, the only feasible way to monitor and understand such an extensive Earth feature, one that literally can change overnight due to wind, snowfall, or melt, is to monitor it with remote sensing tools. A space-based approach is essential to assess whether global stocks of seasonal snow are increasing, decreasing, or shifting in location, pattern, and timing. [1:  This total is based on Northern Hemisphere land areas where 40% of the precipitation comes as snow, plus the area of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. The total would be higher if Greenland and Antarctica were included, and if areas where snowmelt is important to agriculture and commerce, so the figure is conservative.]   a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed? b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs; There are currently no planned NASA programs targeting remote sensing retrieval of SWE or snow depth that address the needs identified here. A small field program designed to establish optimal synergy between existing methods of SWE/depth remote sensing (informally called SnowX) is in the planning stage, but is not yet funded. NASA currently funds a snow lidar program at JPL; this program demonstrates an important capability, but currently has limited geographic extent. Internationally, a retrospective program will be supported by ESA to examine all of the radar data acquired during CoReH2O Phase A, and informal planning is underway for various active and passive microwave missions related to the upcoming ESA Earth Explorer-9 call for missions. None of these efforts is large enough or comprehensive enough to make the substantial progress needed. What is required is a coordinated series of laboratory and field/aircraft programs designed to identify the best way to use radar and lidar in concert, while designing and implementing a seamless modeling and data assimilation system that can ingest, interpret, and extrapolate/interpolate (in time and space) the remote sensing products.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits;  Development of better snow remote sensing will serve science and society through: a) quantification of the state and change of snow resources regionally and globally on relevant time scales, b) improved snow-related water-resource information for managers, planners, and stakeholders, c) SWE information at the spatial resolution and uncertainty requirements necessary to meet operational environmental monitoring needs, services, and prediction, and d) increased information supporting other snow-interactive aspects of the climate-system.  d. The science communities that would be involved. The communities directly involved would include the snow community, the cryospheric community in general (glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and sea ice), and the hydrologic community. There would also be strong interest within the ecology communities, including forest resources, soil-biologic processes, and snow-wildlife interactions; the global change communities for quantification of global water and energy cycles; and the natural hazards communities addressing snowmelt and rain-on-snow flooding, snow avalanches, and landslides.

Monitoring their extent and volumes from   space-based sensors would provide key data needed to   improve sea ice predictions. Photo: Kathryn   Hansen/NASA   The importance of understanding and quantifying surface processes over the cryosphere for   improved climate and sea level rise predictions     Climate change and rising sea levels   present economic, engineering, and societal   challenges for current and future generations.   Two-thirds of the world’s cities have  vulnerable populations of five million or more   living in at-risk areas, less than 10 meters   above sea level. Warming temperatures,   amplified in the Arctic, are melting glaciers   and ice sheets and diminishing Arctic sea ice   extent and volume, creating feedback loops   for further warming (Figure 1).  For decades   US and international agencies have designed   monitoring programs for the cryosphere,   supporting missions to monitor sea ice   extent/concentration and land ice melt extent   (e.g., DMSP), sea ice freeboard and ice sheet   elevation changes (ICESat, Operation   IceBridge (OIB), CryoSat-2 and the future   ICESat-2), albedo variations (e.g., MODIS),   total mass change from gravity (GRACE) and   ice motion (e.g., RADARSAT, TerraSAR-X,   Sentinel-1).  While historical missions advanced our knowledge of the cryosphere, they generally   neglected measurements of crucial parameters driving surface processes (SP) such as melt water   production, runoff, accumulation, and storage/retention, leaving models, constrained by limited in situ   measurements, to estimate SP.  Though OIB monitors SP to a limited extent, as measurements of   opportunity, there are no future planned missions, either space-borne or suborbital, that will directly   measure SP.      1) Key challenges for basic research, applied research, applications, and operations in the coming   decade      The key challenges for surface processes for land and sea ice for the coming decade are:   Basic Research:   1) Quantifying and reducing uncertainties of the spatio-temporal evolution of melt and melt volume  over land and sea ice.    2) Quantifying fluxes and reducing uncertainties of the supraglacial hydrological system over the  Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) especially for runoff and retention.   3) Assessing the contributions of feedback loops and processes connected to albedo (e.g. surface  composition, presence of impurities and biota, and deposition processes).     4) Constraining snow accumulation and mass redistribution processes (e.g., blowing snow, snow  depth) and their impacts on mass balance and on snow-atmosphere heat and chemical exchange   from the ice sheet, sea ice, and ocean.   5) Understanding the relationships between SP and ice flow/dynamics, ocean freshening from  runoff, and internal ice warming from retention/refreeze of melt.   Applied research:   1) Characterizing hydrological systems, improving albedo schemes, and improving accumulation  and snow redistribution in land and sea ice models for improved sea level rise and climate   predictions.     2     A   B   Figure 2: A) Time-series of modeled surface mass   balance (blue) for the GrIS showing stable snowfall (red)   and accelerating run-off (Yellow) since ~2000. (X.   Fettweis) B) The impact of peak run-off in 2012 is   illustrated by the swollen Watson River, near   Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, overtaking and destroying a   bridge. Photo: K. Choquette.         Operations:   1) Providing platforms capable of  collecting data at the required spatial,   spectral and temporal resolution to   monitor SP, specifically for albedo,   melt pond evolution and melt volume   (Table 1).        2) Timeliness and Readiness   Though SP are important over the   entire cryosphere, the contemporary behavior   of the GrIS and Arctic sea ice punctuate the   immediate need for space-based resources   capable of capturing crucial processes that are   currently poorly quantified. In the past two   decades, the GrIS has quadrupled its annual   mass loss and, in the past few years, it has   undergone a paradigm shift, now losing the   majority of its mass from surface runoff   (Figure 2) rather than from ice dynamics (e.g.,   calving).  Melt extent in 2012 covered ~97% of   the ice sheet, with runoff over 2.5 standard   deviations above the mean, causing proglacial   rivers to swell. The destruction of a bridge near   Kangerlussuaq, Greenland (Figure 2)   epitomizes the exceptional runoff in 2012. Also   in 2012, the Arctic sea ice minimum extent   reached a new record low.  The decline of   Arctic sea ice is outpacing model predictions.    Despite the immediate global significance of   GrIS meltwater to sea level rise and the   feedback effects of melt processes on Arctic sea   ice, they remain among the least understood hydrologic systems on Earth.   The dynamic, fine scale   processes of production, transport, storage/retention, and release of freshwater into the oceans are   poorly understood and quantified.        3) Fundamental aspects of space-based observations in addressing key surface process questions   Space-based observations (Table 1) can address key scientific questions and societal needs by   providing the spatio-temporal resolutions required to characterize SP across the cryosphere.   Table 1   provides a list of the measurements needed to overcome the existing limitations and, hence, improve sea   level and climate predictions.  Table 1 provides a general assessment of readiness for space-based   applications and a brief assessment of space-based algorithms, existing field measurements and model   estimates.   While some space-based instruments/technologies currently monitor SP, they are either in   sub-optimal orbits (e.g., GPM, TRIMM), have a coarser spatial and spectral resolution than what is   required to resolve the physical processes (e.g., MODIS), and/or have a coarser temporal resolution than   the physical processes (e.g., WorldView, Landsat, ASTER).    Although we focus here on the scientific measurements, the technologies already exist for the   requested sensors. Monitoring key SP from space will require multiple sensors, including a   multispectral/hyperspectral sensor and a bathymetric lidar for water depths.  Using a CubeSat     3     constellation and/or suborbital assets, like UASs, could increase the temporal resolution for key   measurements.  These resources would constrain the highest priority SP (Table 1) and have additional   applications for hydrology, oceanography and ecology.  The success of an SP mission will be judged by   the quantifiable improvements to process understanding, modeled estimates and data integration into   wider system’s research.     4) Scientific Community Involvement   There is broad support in the scientific community for comprehensive space-based measurements of SP   over the cryosphere.  We expect, and support, additional white papers from other cryospheric scientists   highlighting different scientific foci and instrumentation that will improve our understanding of SP.  This   white paper predominantly focuses on Arctic applications, derived from meeting notes from the SUMup   2012 and PARCA 2014/215 meetings compiled by the NASA SUMup (Surface Mass Balance and Snow   on Sea Ice) Working Group whom has coordinated the SP community and consolidated in situ data to   improve SP models since 2012. This white paper was broadly distributed and has 22 coauthors.

The need to address this  question continues to increase in importance given recent and projected changes in climate,  particularly for water resources availability and related increases in drought frequency and  intensity, and an overall drying of the land surface. The response of the terrestrial biosphere to  changes in climate remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate projections  because ecosystems can act as either carbon sinks (photosynthesis, primary production) or  carbon sources (respiration, decomposition, mortality, combustion), and provide climate  feedbacks through latent heat fluxes, albedo, and water cycling [Friedlingstein et al., 2014].  Food and water security are increasingly under threat due to the challenge of being able to  monitor and understand how our agricultural systems are responding and should be managed  under changing hydrological and climatological regimes [IPCC, 2014].    Most hydrological studies have tended to focus on the supply side of the water ‘coin’ (e.g.,  precipitation, snow, soil moisture, groundwater), yet have largely ignored the demand side (i.e.,  evapotranspiration or ET, the loss of water to the atmosphere). However, increasing droughts and  water demands have now made it critical to understand both sides of this ‘coin’, particularly the  consumptive use and subsequent loss, and vegetation stress response, of water through ET—the  overwhelmingly dominant use of water (Figure 1). ET is a keystone climate variable that  uniquely links the water cycle (evaporation), energy cycle (latent heat flux), and carbon cycle  (transpiration–photosynthesis tradeoff) [Fisher, 2013]. ET is the leading climatic predictor of  biodiversity [Fisher et al., 2011], and the dominant requirement for agricultural water  management (irrigation so that ET approximates atmospheric demand) [Allen et al., 1998;  Anderson et al., 2011]. Critical Earth System Science challenges and questions linking ET to the  overall objective of understanding the fate of the terrestrial biosphere include:      2     • How are natural and managed ecosystems responding to changes in climate and water   availability?  • How much water do different types of plants use?  • What is the timing of plant water use, and how does that vary diurnally, seasonally, and   annually?  • Which areas evaporate more or less water than other areas?  • How does ET redistribute water in the hydrological cycle?  • How do changes in ET amplify or dampen climate feedbacks and hydrometeorological   extremes at local to regional scales?  • Are we witnessing observable changes in hydrological fluxes and acceleration, and if so,   what are the causes and consequences of these?  • Can we unify the water, carbon, and energy cycles globally from spaceborne observation   with ET as the linking variable?  • How should water and ecosystem management adapt to changes in hydrological and   climate variability?  • What information do we need to optimize food security, crop productivity, and water   security in a changing climate to meet the demands of a growing population?    TIMELINESS  In 2005, the worst drought in recorded history enveloped the Amazon basin,  reversing the long-term carbon sink into a carbon source. In 2010, an even stronger drought hit  the Amazon basin, which had not fully recovered from the drought 5 years earlier [Saatchi et al.,  2013]. In 2011, the worst drought in decades hit the US Midwest [Long et al., 2013] and was  followed in 2012 by an even worse drought that impacted 80% of US agriculture [Mallya et al.,  2013]. From 2012-present, many sectors of California’s agriculture have ceased due to a multi- year mega-drought, resulting in depleted surface storage and groundwater aquifers  [AghaKouchak et al., 2014]. Globally, large tracts of boreal forests are drying and becoming  increasingly susceptible to fire [Soja et al., 2007], and temperate forests in close proximity to  high population centers are dying from lack of water [Schwalm et al., 2012].    The hydrological cycle is rapidly changing, resulting in greater variance and more extremes. Our  collective infrastructure is not equipped to buffer these changes in water availability, with  storage and supply now outpaced by demand. US drought predictive capabilities missed the 2012  US Midwest drought magnitude and intensity. While many ecosystems may be unable to adapt  to such changes, human society has the potential to adapt given the right information at the right  time. The deficiency of the US drought predictive capabilities was due in large part to missing  information on land–atmosphere coupling, i.e., ET, and an under-emphasis on the response of  vegetation to drought. One of the few drought metrics to capture the drought magnitude,  intensity, and timing (i.e., early-warning indicator) at resolutions applicable for management was  based on ET: the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) [Anderson et al., 2010]. Water managers need  to know now how to allocate dwindling water resources to benefit society and optimize  productivity, and mitigate economic, societal, legal, and ecological damage. With a global  population of 9B people by 2050, we will need a 60% increase in food production with a  commensurate increase in water from an already stressed hydrological system [IPCC, 2014].        3   Starting in the short-term, we need to maximize and optimize our critical information gathering  on plant–water dynamics to ensure food security and water security, and provide key and timely  feedbacks to climate and biospheric model responses to a changing climate. The science  communities that would capitalize on this information on ET include, in part: I) Agronomy; II)  Ecology; III) Hydrology; IV) Atmospheric; V) Climate; VI) Carbon Cycle; VII) Coastal; VIII)  Computer/Data Science; IX) Statistical; and, X) Policy/Economics.    SPACE-BASED OBSERVATIONS  The space-based challenge necessary to capture the key  science questions on ET dynamics described above demands rigorous observation across nearly  all facets of remote sensing:     - High spatial resolution: length scales required to detect spatially heterogeneous responses  to water environments; i.e., “field-scale” agricultural plots, narrow riparian zones, mixed- species forest/ecosystem assemblages;   - High temporal resolution: ET is highly variable from day to day, thus management  necessitates accurate ET information provided in sync with daily irrigation schedules; ET  also varies throughout the day, particularly under water stress, when vegetation may or  may not shut down water use by closing leaf stomata pores;   - Large spatial coverage: global coverage enables detection of large-scale droughts and is  necessary for climate feedbacks and closing the global water and energy budgets; ensures  consistency in measurements across regions and shared resources;   - Long-term monitoring: droughts and drought responses evolve over the course of  multiple years; as climate becomes increasingly variable, the need for long-term  observations will be increasingly critical.     ET is a multi-faceted variable controlled by a combination of vegetation, atmospheric, and  radiative drivers obtainable from remote sensing [Fisher et al., 2008]. Phenology and vegetation  cover are necessary for seasonal dynamics and relative magnitudes of ET fluxes. Humidity and  air temperature dictate the diffusion of water from the land to the air. Net radiation and land  surface temperature provide the physical drivers for the state change of water and the subsequent  impact on latent and sensible heat partitioning. Critical ground-based observations also synergize  to complete the picture: agricultural practices (irrigation type/management, planting decisions,  nutrients, soil composition, tilling practices, seed types), water quality, plant  plasticity/sensitivity/adaptation response, and computational models (crop, climate, water). The  key information flow or logic pipeline that needs to be fully captured can be distilled to the  following: Stress → Yield → Mortality → Management; this flow, in turn, cycles through itself.    A few current and planned space missions/instruments capture some, but not all, of the  components necessary to meet the requirements for addressing the key science questions,  challenges, and societal benefits described above. For example, Landsat provides excellent  spatial resolution, but poor temporal resolution. MODIS/VIIRS provide good re-visit time, but  insufficient spatial resolution. GOES captures the diurnal cycle, but at the expense of spatial  resolution and coverage. ECOSTRESS will provide excellent spatial, temporal, and spectral  resolutions, but is not an extended mission and does not capture the high latitudes. Sentinel  provides moderate spatial and temporal resolutions. The proposed HyspIRI mission, identified as  a Tier 2 mission in the 2007 Decadal Survey, can provide excellent spatial resolution, good  temporal resolution, and global coverage, but is not designated a Tier 1 mission.       4     RECOMMENDATIONS  Given the existing and planned US and International Programs that  help contribute to the science requirements described above, the primary take-home points of this  White Paper are that in future measurements to support ET:   • We need to improve the frequency of revisits;  • We need to resolve the diurnal cycle;  • We need to maximize spatial resolution and coverage.     While it is unlikely that a panel focused solely on ET or plant–water dynamics is formed, given  the cross-cutting nature of this variable we highly recommend that multiple ET experts are  selected as members on the panels the NRC decides to form. This could be across terrestrial  hydrology, ecosystems/ecology, agriculture/societal benefits, climate, and land–atmosphere  connections/synergies, for example. It is critical that ET features as an important element of such  panels. The science recommendations and discussion throughout this White Paper will hopefully  serve as key anchor points for the Decadal Survey structure and guidance, as well as follow on  RFI solicitations to the Decadal Survey panels.

Summary   Aligning human interests with environmental stewardship of fresh water and coastal  oceans is a grand challenge, particularly in our rapidly changing world.  The future of  these resources is uncertain, and scientific knowledge of processes governing them  remains limited.  Space-based remote sensing provides a pathway to greater global  understanding.      1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science  across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications,  and/or operations in the coming decade?    Rivers, lakes, estuaries, deltas, and coastal oceans are all components of an integrated  system in which water, sediments, and carbon are transferred from the continental land  surface to oceans.  Earth’s water bodies, fresh, brackish, and saline, therefore play key  roles not only in the water cycle but also in geomorphic and biogeochemical cycles.  Additionally, these water bodies host many of the most biologically productive and  diverse ecosystems on Earth and are of critical importance to human economic and social  structures.  Approximately 50% of the Earth’s population lives near coasts1, and an  overlapping ~50% lives within 10 km of a river2. Over the last two decades, science,  applications, and operations community have made substantial progress in understanding  and managing these systems using existing observation and modeling tools.  However,  despite their importance, our scientific understanding of the spatial and temporal  dynamics of water, sediments, and carbon through this integrated network of  rivers/lakes/wetlands/estuaries/coastal oceans often remains limited at scales ranging  from local to global. As we seek to operationally manage human use of these  environments, limited understanding of their dynamics can have direct impacts on  decision-making processes. Moreover, we have limited knowledge of the processes by        2     which changes to this system are driven by global warming, land use and land cover  change, engineering modifications, and industrial/agricultural activities. This knowledge  gap will only widen as human activities intensify and climate change accelerates. As  such, a key question driving scientific research in this area is:    How is the transport of water, sediment, and carbon through the terrestrial surface water  network and coastal oceans altered by natural and human forcings, and how are these  associated changes affecting the human, ecological, and physical systems that coexist  within these environments?      Addressing this question will require new links among diverse scientific communities.   Terrestrial hydrologists, coastal oceanographers, geomorphologists, biogeochemists,  ecologists, and social scientists must work together to understand the changing transport  of water, sediment, and carbon.  The following are three scientific grand challenges, with  significant societal implications, that need to be addressed via further study of this  integrated system:   • Integrating the terrestrial and marine water cycles.  Historically, water cycle  research has focused on either terrestrial process (e.g. atmospheric humidity, soil  moisture) or oceanic processes (e.g. ocean circulation).  This disciplinary  paradigm needs to be changed.  Investigating freshwater transport from  continental interiors to coasts and within coastal ocean environments is not only  compelling science but also is critical for protecting associated ecosystems,  tracking freshwater availability for human use, and developing effective responses  to global sea-level rise.   • Describing global sediment sources, fluxes, and sinks (i.e. erosion, transport,  and deposition).  These physical processes shape our lands and coasts on  timescales from hours (e.g. during flood events) to millennia (e.g. via slow  sediment accretion).  Additionally, human exploration of subsurface resources  (e.g. mining), alteration of the land surface (urban and agricultural), and  modification of water conveyance (e.g. dams, canals, levees) have all impacted  patterns of sedimentation and subsequently, waterbody morphology3.   Understanding human influence on sedimentary and geomorphological processes  and ensuing impacts on infrastructure is crucial for day-to-day management of  coastal and upland environments and for disaster preparedness (e.g. landslides,  floods, sea level rise).  Deltas, important agricultural regions that host hundreds of  millions of people globally, are threatened simultaneously by human  infrastructure development, resource extraction, and the inexorable rise of the  world’s oceans4.  Investments in developing innovative management strategies  directly related to sediment erosion and deposition in deltas such as the  Mississippi are already costing billions of dollars annually and are expected to  further rise5.        • Characterizing the carbon cycle between terrestrial and coastal water bodies.   As sediments, carbon and other nutrients are transported through the hydrologic  network from the land to the coast, they undergo biogeochemical transformations  that culminate at the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Tidal  wetlands are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth with the highest        3     carbon sequestration rates of all ecosystems, and they provide key services to  humans by protecting infrastructure from storm surge, incubating fish  populations, and filtering pollutants6.  Any changes in the hydrologic regime, and  changes in upstream sediment and nutrient loading rates, can reduce their  productivity and structure resulting in potentially irreversible damages to these  valuable wetland and coastal ocean ecosystems. While it is clear these ecosystems  regulate the water flow and mass (i.e. nutrient, carbon, salt) exchange at the  coastal boundary, our understanding of their role and impact at regional scales  remains limited by our current observational capabilities.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially  with respect to readiness?     The challenges of aligning ever-increasing human population growth and a changing  climate with sustainable environmental stewardship are particularly ubiquitous at the  confluence of land and sea.  Land loss in coastal areas is likely due to a combination of  factors including sea-level rise, subsidence, and diminished sediment supplies, which are  all being directly and indirectly accelerated by human activities (e.g. global climate  change, river engineering, and local petroleum and water extraction).  Deforestation has  increased carbon fluxes into surface water bodies and outgassing from them7,8.  Land use  and land cover changes in urban areas have modified surface runoff dynamics and  composition9.   Intense fertilizer usage has created riverine and coastal algal blooms and  their associated toxicity and hypoxic zones are detrimental to local ecosystems10.  This  situation thus creates an urgent scientific need to better understand the physical,  biogeochemical, and human-mediated processes operating at the interfaces between  terrestrial and coastal oceanic systems.        Existing physical and biogeochemical models are increasingly capable of simulating  these complex environments, but initial efforts have either consisted of local case studies  or global efforts incorporating major assumptions necessary due to the absence of  synoptic observations11.  Similarly, a lack of integrated approaches limits our  understanding of how hydrologic, coastal, geomorphic, and biogeochemical processes are  coupled. Moreover, the understanding of the biogeophysical processes must be coupled  with the human dimension, e.g., how can human constructs evolve toward a system with  more desirable economic and ecological outcomes? The scientific communities focused  on land/coastal/ocean systems must now work together to address these problems in a  more integrated, holistic manner.     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?    Point-scale measurements of river discharge, sediment flux, and carbon content are  strong assets, but they are sparsely available and are in global decline12,13.  In situ gauges  are of comparatively limited utility in complex two-dimensional flow environments  including wetlands, floodplains, estuaries, and coastal oceans.  There is thus a need for        4     spatially distributed measurements of terrestrial water stores and fluxes, surface  concentrations of sediment and carbon.  Remote sensing technologies, combined with in- situ measurements and models, offer the best alternative to improve understanding of  large-scale biogeophysical processes. The remote sensing science and engineering  communities have recently begun to develop the types of hardware (i.e. instruments) and  software (i.e. algorithms) needed to adequately address these pressing questions.       The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, currently under  development by NASA and CNES, with an expected launch of 2019, is expected to  provide the first simultaneous, two dimensional measurements of water surface elevation  and inundation extent in rivers, lakes, many wetlands, and oceans around the world14.  Unlike legacy nadir altimeters such as the JASON series, it is designed to measure the  submesoscale vertical and horizontal surface ocean structures required to understand the  movement of water in coastal ocean environments.  New methods have also been  developed to estimate variations in river discharge (for rivers wider than 50-100 m) and  surface-water storage variability directly from the expected SWOT measurements, with  no requirement for in situ information.  As such, technology developed for SWOT would  improve our ability to monitor the movement of water on land and in the ocean.    In addition, the ongoing development of optical sensors, including multispectral and  hyperspectral airborne instruments (e.g. AVIRIS-NG, PRISM) is providing new  information on sediment concentrations and measures of organic material, such as  colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and chlorophyll concentrations, that can be  used to infer carbon transport and perhaps nutrient loading. A large number of studies  dating back to at least the mid-1970s have demonstrated that SSC, CDOM, and  chlorophyll in rivers, lakes, and coastal oceans can be robustly retrieved using optical  instruments15,16.  However, virtually all of these studies relied upon empirical  relationships with spectral reflectance that are local or regional in nature17.  Developing  global relationships with reflectance remains challenging due, for example, to variations  in sediment color, grain size, and other optical properties of the water column. In  addition, separating out the influence of CDOM, chlorophyll, and sediment on  reflectance, though possible, is not always simple15.  Nonetheless, several recent studies  have shown that these site-specific relationships are quite robust and could be transferred  to other locales15,17, suggesting that an appropriately designed optical remote sensing  system could yield useful information on sediment and organic matter around the globe.     The rapid temporal variations in hydrologic and oceanic systems require truly  simultaneous measurements of water flux and concentrations of sediment and carbon to  reliably estimate the total fluxes of all three quantities.  Such synoptic data must also be  provided for response to floods, harmful algal blooms, and other events impacting human  activities.  The current array of in situ, airborne, and space-based sensors are providing  important disparate datasets that provide invaluable technical heritage, but they cannot  deliver simultaneous, high-resolution measurements.  The grand challenges outlined  here will therefore not be addressed unless such synchronous, high-resolution  observations of fluxes in water, sediment, and organic materials are gathered  globally.  Additionally, despite the strengths of current and expected observing        5     capabilities, technical barriers remain.  The small spatial scales of river channels,  especially in many deltaic environments, mandate higher spatial resolution than can be  expected from SWOT.  General multispectral instruments such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel  2 were not specifically designed to track water, sediment, and carbon in fluvial and  oceanic environments. Synchronous, high-resolution, optimized remotely sensed data  would provide instantaneous snapshots of transport processes that could be validated and  combined with existing in situ measurements, assimilated into next-generation numerical  models, and used to extend climate records begun by other sensors (e.g. SWOT).  The  integration of hydrology, geomorphology, and biogeochemistry will likely impact  sustainable management from the mountains to the sea.    References  1. Vitousek, P. M.

One of the greatest challenges facing society is the need to develop targeted, optimal strategies for both  improving air quality and reducing anthropogenic global warming.  The well-mixed greenhouse gases  CO2 and CH4 and short-lived air quality species ozone and aerosols together constitute the largest  components of radiative forcing, and they are coupled through common anthropogenic, biogenic, and  chemical processes [Arneth et al, 2010].  Development of such mitigation strategies therefore requires  an integrated approach to accurately quantifying emissions and relating them to atmospheric  concentrations and radiative forcing.   Quantifying CO2 and CH4 emissions is a national [Pacala et al., 2010] and international [IPCC, 2007]  priority. Fossil fuel emissions of CO2 (FFCO2), 45% of which are produced by the US and China, are the  largest net flux in the current global carbon cycle and their uncertainty is projected to surpass the  magnitude of land emissions (11.0 PgC-1) by 2020 [World Energy Outlook, 2010]. Additional large  uncertainties in carbon storage and exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere  prevent closure of the carbon budget at all scales.  CH4 emissions are even less well-known, with the  best national inventories reporting uncertainties from individual sectors of ± (20–50) % [US EPA, 2012].   CH4 plays a critical role in both short and long-term climate warming [Shindell et al, 2012], and changes  in its atmospheric burden over the past decade, which appear to be driven by changes in tropical  emissions [Kirschke et al., 2013], are not well-understood.     The emissions and atmospheric burdens of long- and short-lived climate forcers are inextricably linked.   In the US, a dramatic shift in energy dependence from coal (with large CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions) to  natural gas over the past decade-and-a-half has improved air quality [de Gouw et al., 2014] but driven  increases in CH4 [e.g. Lu et al, 2012] as well as in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during  natural gas extraction.  Air quality regulations have reduced CO and NOx emissions, abating tropospheric  ozone pollution and attenuating its climate forcing, but driving increases in CH4 lifetime and radiative  forcing.  At the same time, background ozone has increased due to transport of ozone and its precursors  from Eastern China [Verstraeten et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015].    Rapid population growth and industrialization in China combined with dependence on coal as an energy  source has driven rapid increases not only in CO2, but also NOx and SO2, with disastrous consequences  for air quality.  More than 4000 people die every day in China from particulate matter (PM) exposure  [Rohde and Muller, 2015].  These rapid changes in Chinese emissions have had complex and uncertain  implications for climate forcing from ozone, CH4, and aerosols due to the dependence of ozone radiative  effect on the location of emissions [Bowman and Henze, 2012], the opposing responses of CH4 lifetime     to tropospheric ozone precursors NOx and CO, and large uncertainties in aerosol direct and indirect  effects.   Addressing the challenge of developing strategies for optimizing the co-evolution of air quality and  climate forcing therefore requires:   1. Accurate knowledge of emissions of FFCO2, CH4, and precursors of tropospheric ozone and  aerosols   2. Reduced uncertainties in the magnitude and variability of CO2 land fluxes to allow better closure  of the carbon budget   3. Quantification of how changes in precursor emissions affect tropospheric ozone and aerosols  and their radiative forcing locally and globally    4. Understanding of how emissions controls targeting ozone affect CH4 through better  understanding of, and constraints on, OH.   Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Regulation of air quality and climate gases over next several decades will be critical in terms of  protecting human and ecosystem health and limiting anthropogenic global warming over the next  century.  In the US, we are nearing the point at which further air quality gains require reductions in  energy production and consumption.  The Chinese response to air quality concerns may commit the  country to either a high or low carbon pathway, depending on whether they continue to invest in  reducing pollutant emissions from coal-based power plants [Karplus, 2015] or shift toward natural gas  and renewable energy [Sheehan et al., 2014].    From a technological point of view, the upcoming geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) missions TEMPO  (NASA), GEMS (KARI), and Sentinel 4 (ESA) will provide unprecedented new capabilities to assess the  evolution of air quality from space [Bowman, 2013] and will feed continued advances in inverse  modeling and data assimilation that permit attribution of composition changes to spatially explicit  emissions [Streets et al, 2013] and multi-species assimilation that can provide, for example, constraints  on OH (which is critical to understanding and predicting changes in CH4 lifetime and burden) [Miyazaki et  al., 2012].  However, as discussed in the next section, these observations were not designed for  quantifying climate forcing, nor do they make key carbon measurements.  The GEO-CAPE Atmospheric  Science Working Group, a broad cross-section of ~35 scientists from universities and government  laboratories participating in pre-formulation studies for the GEO-CAPE air quality mission recommended  by the 2007 Decadal Survey [http://geo-cape.larc.nasa.gov/], has endorsed this white paper in  recognition of the need for and value of additional measurements to tackle this challenge.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Climate forcing occurs at the global scale but is initiated from fluxes and emissions at local scales, which  are also the main drivers of air quality.  Measurements from ground-based networks provide accurate  samples of concentrations and fluxes, with limited geographic coverage. Airborne platforms provide  frequent sampling that is limited to selected regions or intensive campaigns. Only satellite  measurements can capture the daily, seasonal and interannual variability of key emissions and  processes at the spatiotemporal scales needed to inform optimized air quality and climate mitigation  strategies.     The GEO-CAPE pre-formulation studies have shown  that monitoring and understanding air quality  requires multiple observations per day, at  horizontal resolutions of ~10 km or finer and with  as much near-surface sensitivity as possible, in  order to separate emissions sources at the urban  scale, understand diurnal and day-to-day variability  in emissions and chemical processing, and provide  sufficient measurement statistics to enable  quantitative studies in cloudy regions [e.g. Fishman  et al., 2012].  Likewise, multiple measurements of  CO2 and CH4 per day at high spatial resolution are  needed to constrain fluxes (Figure 1 and Bousserez  et al. [2015]) and map emissions, including those  with large diurnal variability such as CH4 “super- emitters”, at policy-relevant scales and uncertainty  levels.  For this reason, a recent European  Commission report on monitoring of FFCO2  emissions recommends geostationary CO2  measurements [EC Report, 2015].     Sentinel 4, TEMPO, and GEMS will measure multiple air quality species at <8km x 8km spatial resolution  multiple times per day over Europe, the US, and part of East Asia.  Sentinel 4, however, is the only  mission that will have concurrent measurements of CO, a key ozone precursor and tracer of  anthropogenic activity that provides constraints on OH (which couples CH4 and O3), and thermal infrared  (TIR) ozone, which can quantify free tropospheric ozone and its radiative effect.  None of the  geostationary missions will measure the key climate forcers CH4 and CO2.    JPSS, the MetOP series, and Sentinel 5/5p will provide global LEO coverage of many of the relevant air  quality species.   However, these measurements lack the spatiotemporal resolution needed to  sufficiently understand and quantify the link between emissions and atmospheric concentrations at the  scales needed to optimize emissions regulations.  Furthermore, many of these missions are funded to  provide a routine set of data to weather forecasting communities and the simplified, fast retrieval  approaches needed for that purpose are not well-suited to the quantitative analysis needed for climate  forcing. There is no current pathway to producing optimally-retrieved products operationally.  Other  ongoing and planned missions will provide CO2 columns from LEO orbit. These measurements are well- suited for studying the global carbon cycle in an aggregated sense (near-continental spatial scales and  monthly periods), but again lack the spatiotemporal resolution and sampling density needed to  constrain fluxes and reduce emissions uncertainties at the required level.     To support national priorities, there is therefore a need for a TEMPO follow-on mission to provide  geostationary measurements of not only air quality species, but also TIR ozone, CO, CH4, and CO2 (see  also white paper by D. Jacob et al. on “Air Quality and Climate Forcing over North America in the Next  Decade”).  Measuring these species concurrently provides several advantages. For ozone, combining  TIR measurements, which have enabled constraints on ozone radiative forcing [Bowman et al., 2013]  and are being used to benchmark model radiative transfer codes, with those in the UV/VIS provides   Figure 1. OSSE simulations of weekly clear-sky CO2  sampling frequency for a combined GOSAT+OCO-2+OCO- 3 constellation (top left) and for nominal geostationary  measurements (bottom left).  The 10x more frequent  measurements from GEO provide a 5- to 10-fold  reduction in flux errors (1-posterior error/prior  error)(right).     robust sensitivity to near-surface ozone [Natraj et al., 2011; Zoogman et al., 2011], which is critical for  understanding effects on human health and ecosystems.  Concurrent measurement of CO2 and CH4  significantly improves detection of anthropogenically-enhanced CH4 concentrations [Gerilowski et al.,  2011] and provides a greater reduction in uncertainty in CH4 emissions than CH4 measurements alone  [Wong et al., 2015].  Given that both CO2 and CH4 have significant natural sources, measuring them in  combination with CO and NO2 provides much-improved ability to identify fossil fuel-based emissions  [Newman et al., 2013; Lindenmaier et al., 2014].     These measurements would benefit the air quality and carbon cycle communities and would support the  Congressionally-mandated Carbon Monitoring System goals of informing carbon policy and  management.  They would provide a foundation for decision-making aimed at optimizing emissions  controls to improve air quality and prevent dangerous warming of the climate system.  Extension of a  US-based mission’s spatial coverage to include South America would allow much-improved constraints  on tropical wetland CH4 emissions and climate forcing associated with biomass burning, while additional  GEO or LEO satellites providing the required spatiotemporal resolution over the rest of the globe would  serve as an integrated, global air quality / climate forcing monitoring system covering regions with the  most rapidly growing emissions (see also companion white paper on “The Future of Air Quality in the  Developing World”).

A session of the NASA  Health and Air Quality Applications Team Meeting held in Park City, Utah, from September 16- 17, 2015, was dedicated to addressing this survey.  The meeting brought together health and air  quality experts who are project investigators for the NASA Applied Sciences Program (ASP),  NASA Health and Air Quality personnel, and stakeholder agencies that use Earth observation  data and systems.  The objective of the Decadal Survey session was to develop recommendations  for a balanced program that would advance the understanding of Earth system processes that  affect public health and air quality and identify how this information could be harnessed for the  benefit of society.      Description:  Domestic and international officials have increasingly recognized links between environment  and health.  The World Health Organization (WHO) states “environmental hazards are  responsible for as much as a quarter of the total burden of disease worldwide.”1  Recognizing  such links, the 2007 report Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for  the Next Decade (commonly referred to as the first Decadal Survey) in its “vision for the future”  of Earth Science and applications, specifically called for “a vision that includes advances in  fundamental understanding of the Earth system and increased application of this understanding  to serve the nation and the people of the world.”  The report also highlighted the use of satellite  data for “targeted interventions to reduce vulnerability to health risks, and enhanced knowledge  of human health-environment interactions”.2  NASA maintains a diverse constellation of Earth  observing research satellites and sponsors research in developing satellite data applications  across a wide spectrum of areas including environmental health; infectious disease; air quality  standards, policies, and regulations; and the impact of climate change on health and air quality.   Successfully providing predictions with the accuracy, latency, and specificity required by  decision makers will require advancements over current capabilities in a number of interrelated  areas. These areas include observations, modeling systems, forecast development, application  integration, and the research to operations transition process.  NASA has been a primary partner  with operational agencies over the past fifteen years in these areas.                                                                                                                                                                                              1 http://www.who.int/phe/en/.  2 NRC (2007): Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and  Beyond: Committee on Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Community Assessment and Strategy for the  Future, National Research Council ISBN: 978-0-309-10387-9, 456 pages, 8 1/2 x 11, paperback (2007);  http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html       2        Participants Input and Recommendations for the Decadal Survey:   The group of experts and stakeholders referenced above convened in Park City to identify and  prioritize future needs and to identify potential questions that may be included in the new  Decadal Survey.  The interim report, Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Midterm  Assessment of NASA's Implementation of the Decadal Survey, framed the group’s discussion.   Participants discussed key issues towards fostering the Earth observations-based applications  community in the coming decade. The key discussion points of this session were:       • What has worked and what hasn’t in the health and air quality applications community  since the first Decadal Survey?   • How do we fix what is not working while scaling up what is working well in order to  develop productive societal applications?        In accordance with this RFI, the paper is organized around the following questions:      1. What are the key challenges or questions for health and air quality applications in the  coming decade?   Earth observations from satellites and in situ collection sites are critical for an ever-increasing  number of applications related to the health and well-being of society. Fundamental  improvements are needed in existing observation and information systems in the following three  areas:  1) collection of raw observations with improved spatial and temporal accuracy; 2)  analyses, forecasts, and model/product developments to provide timely and coherent syntheses  of otherwise disparate information; and 3) outreach and capacity building for decision-makers  who use these analyses and forecasts to produce actions for direct societal benefit.    Key space-based observational and informational needs by the community include:     • Growth in near real-time satellite products, as these often produce immediate societal   impact.      • Wider availability and ease of data accessibility for researchers with limited time or  capacity to learn new processes (e.g., more products that are easily compatible with GIS  systems). The establishment of an Applications Distributed Active Archive Center  (DAAC) was recommended.      • Clear documentation and availability of related publications and metadata to validate  research processes. This includes documentation of model development and validation  with associated estimations of uncertainty.     • Balance between rapid delivery of near-ready (“beta test”) models in matters of time- sensitivity and models of longer-term testing and validation.      3               2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?     Environmental health risks are a major concern.  Particulate matter in the lower troposphere can  cause or exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cause heart attacks, decreased  lung function, and asthma.  According to Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Integrated  Science Assessment (ISA) for Particulate Matter (PM) released in 2009, visits and hospital  admissions for heart diseases reported consistent positive associations, with the majority of  epidemiological studies reporting increases ranging from 0.5 to 3.4% per 10 µg/m  3  increase in   PM2.5.3  Based on the 2009 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), it was estimated that 39.9  million Americans had been diagnosed with asthma within their lifetime.4     Research has shown that environmental factors such as water temperature, land surface  temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation contribute to infectious disease outbreaks.  Changes  in weather and climate conditions can affect infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever,  and Rift Valley Fever.  Changes in temperature, humidity and habitat affect the lifecycle and  transmission effectiveness of disease vectors.  These parameters also affect vector interaction  with humans.  Changes in climate and weather can affect the distribution of some mosquito and  rodent habitats, particularly in mountainous regions.5   “Grand challenges” identified for the community included:     • Malaria: Risk characterization models are currently deployed regionally. A unified   dynamic malaria risk model would be a major achievement for end-users worldwide and  would provide economic savings by scale and through elimination of redundant,  competing models.      • Air Quality:  Accurate ground-level aerosol and constituent measurements from  remotely-sensed columnar values are critical.  While progress has been made in this area  thanks to investments in algorithm development and targeted field campaigns, large  discrepancies still remain.  Ozone is a critical issue in this regard; aerosols over land  areas with high albedo also have large discrepancies.  Even developed countries, such as  the USA, have relatively sparse ground level aerosol networks – with remotely sensed  observations providing critical data to fill coverage gaps.  Developing countries have  even fewer ground sensors – and sometimes none at all.       • “One Health” Community of Practice:  It has become clear that human health, animal  health, and ecosystem health are inextricably linked, yet these disciplines have often  worked as completely separate entities.  The integration of human medicine, veterinary                                                                                                                                                                                          3 http://www.epa.gov/ncea/pdfs/partmatt/Dec2009/PM_ISA_full.pdf  4 http://www.lung.org/finding-cures/our-research/trend-reports/asthma-trend-report.pdf  5 http://csis.org/files/publication/110927_Wigbels_UsingEarthObserHealth_WEB.pdf     4        medicine and environmental science is now seen as crucial in tackling the health and air  quality challenges facing the planet.         3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?      Space-based observations provide a unique vantage point to address health and air quality  applications, particularly in the developing world where only sparse in situ coverage exists.     Remotely sensed observations provide critical components for integration with various forecasts,  models, and decision support systems.  These observations are key in addressing the complexity  associated with health and environment relationships due to the diversity and number of  potentially confounding variables.  Research is needed on integrating climate science with health  and air quality science; integrating environmental, public health, and marine and wildlife  surveillance; integrating socio-economic data; applying climate and meteorological observations  to real-time issues; and the down-scaling of long-term climate models.    In many cases, space-based observations are beneficial to both fundamental research and  applications that benefit society, albeit at different latency and spatial/temporal resolution  requirements.  For example, for many years while climate has been the main focus of aerosol  research at NASA, aerosols are an important component of the air quality health index through  their effects on human health, biological productivity, visibility, and boundary layer chemistry.   Therefore, it is imperative that future science missions maximize the science and applications  return on the nation’s investment by designing missions that will deliver products at a latency  and spatial/temporal resolution that can be used for applications.        Future highly desirable measurements were addressed by the session.  For example, thermal  imagery is important for urban heat island studies, prediction of episodes of harmful algal  blooms (HABs), prediction of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, carbon fixation, etc.  Currently  there are no high spatial and temporal resolution thermal imagery products available except for a  few isolated aircraft measurements.    Additionally, many session participants stated that the next generation of space lidar (e.g., ACE)  must be a significant improvement over CALIPSO.  A pointing capability, though more  expensive and a higher risk to operate, could provide a significantly higher return in benefits to  society.  During disasters such as a volcanic eruption, intentional or accidental catastrophic  emission of hazardous gases or particles, or wildfires, knowledge of the horizontal extent,  altitude, and concentration of the emissions plume would be critical for public health or aviation  safety policy.  A pointing lidar could also profile tropical cyclones to improve estimates of storm  dynamics, amount of precipitable water, cloud-top height, and potential landfall impacts to  inform public health decisions and risk avoidance.   Additionally, the group discussed the future use of small satellites, cube satellites, and well- designed applications for mobile devices which could enable the combination of Earth observing     5        satellite measurements and citizen-science to increase available data, public participation, and  number and use of products.      Conclusion:   The health and air quality community was appreciative of the opportunity to provide inputs for  the Decadal Survey during the NASA Health and Air Quality Applications Team Meeting in  September 2015 at Park City, Utah. The participants provided many useful suggestions for  consideration over the next ten years ranging from desired measurements, to public-, private-  sector and citizen engagement, to strategies for increasing the sustained use of applications  products. The meeting underscored the importance of Earth observations for applications and the  reliance on these measurements from several stakeholder communities.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Since 1995, Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports have highlighted, as leading uncertainties in understanding Earth’s climate, the direct impact of airborne particles on the planetary energy balance, and the indirect impact they have on clouds, atmospheric stability, and regional circulation.  Further, the presence of aerosols often necessitates large corrections to other space-based measurements of independent parameters, such as ocean color and productivity [e.g., Gordon, 1997], and they cause much more premature mortality than ozone, NOx, or other pollutants [Lelieveld et al., 2015].  As such, frequent, global aerosol-air-mass-type mapping, of value in itself for air quality, material transport, and other applications, represents critical test and validation data for climate modeling. (In satellite remote sensing, “aerosol type” describes the categorical component and mixture distinctions made from varying observational information content about particle size, shape, and absorption.) Besides measuring total-column aerosol optical depth, some current satellite remote-sensing instruments are capable of deriving vertical backscatter profiles and constraints on the size, shape, and light-absorption properties of airborne particles. Next-generation multi-angle, multi-spectral polarimeter-imagers and high-spectral-resolution lidars (HSRLs) promise to provide tighter constraints on aerosol type, under a broader range of conditions.   However, space-based radiance observations are only as good as their inherent information content, and the retrieval algorithms or assimilation and other models that interpret them in terms of geophysical quantities.  Satellite and suborbital remote-sensing data alone cannot constrain the microphysical, optical, and chemical properties of airborne particles sufficiently to reduce the aerosol-related direct and especially indirect forcing uncertainties to levels comparable to that of greenhouse-gas forcing. Nor can health effects be derived solely from remote-sensing data.  For example, Mass Extinction Efficiencies (MEEs) are required to translate between remote-sensing-derived particle optical properties and aerosol mass, which is the fundamental quantity tracked in aerosol-transport and climate models.  MEEs must be obtained from in situ measurements, estimated from modeled particle composition and size distributions, or simply assumed.  Similarly, particle water uptake (hygroscopicity), required to account for humidity-dependent particle optical property changes as well as particle activation conditions that initiate cloud formation, cannot be derived from remote-sensing observations except under special conditions [Pahlow et al., 2006]. And even advanced future remote-sensing instruments will only loosely constrain particle light absorption properties, helpful for aerosol source-attribution such as identifying anthropogenic components, and a key to simulating atmospheric heating profiles, cloud evolution, especially in polluted or smoky environments, and broader climate effects.   Characterizing particulate matter in Earth’s atmosphere adequately for many climate and air quality applications requires the combination of space-based sensors, suborbital observations including in situ measurements, and models.   2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   We already have over 15 years of satellite data from the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) instruments. This represents a data record sufficiently long to begin identifying trends in aerosol forcing, assessing regional air quality changes, providing aerosol-forcing constraints on climate models, and testing climate and air quality model performance.  However, the missing particle microphysical, chemical, and associated optical detail limits the utility of the satellite data for these applications.  Obtaining systematic in situ measurements of the major aerosol air masses globally would allow the field to advance significantly even with existing satellite data, and would provide context and impetus for future space-based aerosol missions.  And to the degree that current imperatives include reducing uncertainty in climate modeling, as well as air quality mapping over extended populated and vegetated areas, such data offers a timely and essential component.     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Aerosols are extremely variable in time and space; they have localized sources, short atmospheric lifetimes, and are removed intermittently, mainly by precipitation. No surface or aircraft in situ instruments can come close to measuring the distribution of aerosols with the frequent, global coverage achieved by space-based sensors. Yet assimilation models and most retrieval algorithms that ingest space-based-sensor radiances require aerosol property constraints that, if not assumed, can only be obtained from in situ measurements.  So an approach to global aerosol measurement that combines extensive satellite remote-sensing observations, but having limited information content, with the detail available from in situ methods, provides a major opportunity to improve the overall flow from sensor to final scientific product. In addition to satellite and suborbital remote-sensing, the challenge of measuring particulate matter in Earth’s atmosphere calls for a suite of instruments in a moderately sized aircraft package, to measure in situ aerosol microphysical, chemical, and associated optical properties operationally, at a level-of-detail unobtainable from space or ground-based remote sensing, with the aim of complementing and adding value to existing and future global satellite aerosol observations.  The aircraft measurements would: (1) improve the aerosol property assumptions made in most satellite aerosol-retrieval-algorithm climatologies and radiance-assimilation models, (2) reduce the uncertainties in comparing and constraining modeled, species-specific aerosol size and mass with satellite aerosol optical values, and (3) provide missing data needed to reduce direct and indirect aerosol forcing uncertainties. Technologies capable of making all the requisite measurements have flown before. However, the collection of coincident measurements needed to adequately characterize the particles in a given aerosol air mass has never before been made, let alone acquired repeatedly, as is needed to represent aerosol air masses statistically and build a large-scale climatology.  The effort would draw upon the aerosol aircraft community to provide instruments and data products, the satellite measurement and aerosol modeling communities to offer context for the measurements and to develop climatologies of aerosol-air-mass-type space-time distribution. It would require the combined expertise of all these communities to interpret the data, assess tradeoffs, and make decisions to efficiently meet the objectives.  Systematic Aircraft Measurements to Characterize Aerosol Air Masses (SAM-CAAM) is feasible because, for most aerosol sources and specified seasons, emitted and evolved particle properties tend to be repeatable, even if the aerosol loading varies from season-to-season and year-to-year.  For example, the amounts of wildfire smoke from Alaskan boreal forests and desert dust from the Bodele Depression vary dramatically with time, but the particle properties from each of these sources remain pretty constant.  This important simplifying attribute means that an airborne observing program designed to routinely and economically measure particle properties in situ could capture probability distribution functions (PDFs) of these properties, characterizing the major aerosol air mass types in the detail needed to adequately address the key aerosol and climate-related questions raised above.  The PDF statistics will also provide important clues to the degree aerosol properties from given sources are repeatable, both near-source and downwind. This capability would require an operational data stream and a dedicated, Sherpa or Twin-Otter-class aircraft to fly routinely from a base of operations, with several pre-defined flight plans, until the accessible aerosol air masses are statistically characterized, after which it would move to another base of operations and repeat the process.  As such, it would be a modest but critical adjunct to the satellite instruments, more like the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) than the typical aircraft field campaign.

Although source composition is as  important as dust amount, dust composition is poorly constrained. Global space spectroscopic  measurement of surface mineralogy closes this knowledge gap.      White Paper     What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?    Mineral dust emitted from the Earth surface into the atmosphere affects climate through direct radiative  forcing and indirectly through cloud formation as well as changes in the albedo and melting of snow/ice.   Based on their chemistry, the minerals in dust react and modify tropospheric photochemistry and acidic  deposition. Mineral dust aerosols affect ocean and terrestrial ecosystem biogeochemical cycling by  supplying limiting nutrients such as iron and phosphorus. In populated regions, mineral dust is a natural  hazard that affects human health and safety.  A summary of Earth system processes impacted by mineral   Table 1.  Mineral dust impacts a broad range of physical and chemical Earth system processes.

Importantly, all of these impacts are quite  different for different minerals, and yet for most of these impact we assume soils are homogeneous across  the planet.  Studies which attempt to differentiate the various mineralogical impacts on climate and  biogeochemistry suggest that the mineralogy is just as, if not more, important than the amount of dust  (Sokolik, 1999,Atkinson, 2013, Shi, 2012 ).    To accurately understand the Earth’s current and potential future mineral dust cycle, measurement and  modeling of the source, transport, and deposition of the dust cycle are required.   For the transport  component, considerable investments have been made in space-based observation (MISR, MODIS, etc.)  and more are planned (ACE and international).  In contrast, the current mineral dust source knowledge for  the Earth is primarily constrained by analyses from agricultural soil maps with mineralogy traced to  ≤5000 soil mineralogical analyses globally and the  most prolific dust sources lack sufficient sampling.      To close this knowledge gap of surface dust source composition, a new space-based spectroscopic  measurement of the Earth’s surface mineral dust source regions could be acquired in one to two years.   Spectroscopic measurements in the 380 to 2510 nm range with 10 nm contiguous spectral sampling and ≤100 m spatial sampling are required.  Such a measurement would improve mineral dust source  knowledge by sampling of order one million more areas and support a number of science communities  and as well as provide direct societal benefit.    Current Earth system models are ready to accept accurate Earth surface mineral dust source composition.   For example, NASA/GISS ModelE2 (Miller et al. 2006; Schmidt et al., 2014) and NCAR CESM (Hurrell  et al, 2013), with the embedded atmospheric model CAM5 (Neale et al., 2012, Mahowald et al., 2006).  Both models contribute to the Climate Model Inter comparison Projects (CMIP), which contribute to the  IPCC.  Comparisons of model predictions of mineral distributions with in situ dust sampling cannot  simulate all features (Scanza et al., 2015), hence the need for comprehensive and direct measurement of  surface dust source composition.    In addition to global impacts, the arid regions of the Earth are vulnerable to small shifts in climate and the  related impacts of surface emitted mineral dust.  For example, the largest changes in precipitation  recorded in the 20th Century have occurred over the Sahel region of North Africa (e.g. Stocker et al.,  2013). Climate modeling demonstrates that the incorporation of realistic mineral dust models improves  predictions of temperature and precipitation changes over arid regions (e.g., Miller and Tegen, 1998;  Yoshioka et al., 2007; Mahowald et al., 2010), and the impact of dust is a function of the mineralogy and  spatial distribution of soils in dust source regions (e.g. Perlwitz et al., 2001; Ginoux et al., 2012; Ward et  al., 2014; Miller et al., 2014; Scanza et al., 2015).     Accurate and comprehensive measurement of the Earths mineral dust source regions are required now to  reduce the uncertainty in current understanding and modeling of this component of the Earth system and  for future prediction of how the Earths dust cycle may evolve under a range of future climate scenarios.    Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?    The Earth’s mineral dust cycle impacts multiple components of the Earth system (Table 1).  The dust  cycle consists of a source, transport and deposition phase.  The current poor knowledge of the  composition of the Earth’s mineral dust source regions is limiting current understanding and modeling  research and future projections of the dust cycle as the climate system changes including feedbacks.   Earth system models are ready to accept accurate constraint of the composition of surface mineral dust  source regions.         The technology for the required measurements is now ready based on investments over the past decade by  the for the 2007 HyspIRI Decadal Survey mission.  A 2014 and follow-on 2015 study shows an imaging  spectrometer with full spectral coverage from 380 to 2510 nm with 10 nm sampling as well as a 185 km  swath and 30 m spatial sampling could be accommodated on a small satellite and launch from a low cost  Pegasus rocket.  This global terrestrial mission would fully meet the requirements to measure the Earth  dust source mineral composition.  Such a mission would complement the current and planned fine and  coarse spatial sampling multispectral missions (Landsat, VIIRS, etc.) as well as enable new scientific  research and application across a range of disciplines based on the full spectroscopic measurement.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?    The mineral dust source regions are distributed across the arid lands of the terrestrial surface in the  Southern and Northern hemispheres typically between +-54 degrees latitude.  The spatial area is estimated  at 2.8x107 km2.  Given the large area and territorial access factors, no ground or airborne strategy can  provide the compressive and uniform measurements required to address this Earth system science  challenge.  Even if airspace access could be arranged, measurement of the Earth dust source regions could  take >10 years and cost in excess of $150M and would be heterogeneous in space and time.  The current  possible future international space based target sampling imaging spectrometer missions are designed to  strictly focused mission requirements and do not have the collection capacity or low distortion  measurements required to address this challenge.  Comprehensive space based spectroscopic observations  of the Earths arid land regions are the fundamental observation required to provide the uniform  compositional knowledge of mineral dust source regions and adjacent lands at risk for desertification that  is needed to address this Earth system science challenge.    A demonstration of this approach has been tested at the Salton Sea, CA area with measurements acquired  by the high altitude Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)(Figure 1).   The Salton  Sea is a known mineral dust source region.  The capability to measure the surface dust source mineral  composition was demonstrated using spectral fitting to the distinct spectral signatures of the minerals of  interest.     Figure 1.  (a) Airborne imaging spectrometer measurement of the Salton Sea, CA mineral dust source area  used to map surface mineral dust source composition.  (b) Spectra of key dust source minerals in the  spectral range from 380 to 2510 nm.  (c) Spectral fitting results to derive surface mineral composition.   (d) Spectroscopically derived surface mineralogy for the Salton Sea, CA dust source region.     From space, a comprehensive measurement of the Earth’s surface mineral dust source regions could be  acquired with spectroscopic measurements spanning in the 380 to 2510 nm spectral region with 10 nm  contiguous sampling and 30 m sampling from the ISS or a smallsat polar orbiter in one or two years.  This  new space based measurement of the Earth’s dust source region will improve the state of knowledge of  mineral dust source composition by ≥106.  This advance benefits a diverse range of science communities:  climate through the dust impacts of direct radiative forcing and indirectly through cloud formation;  cryosphere through changes in the albedo and melting of snow/ice; atmospheric composition through the  chemical impact of mineral on tropospheric photochemistry and acidic deposition; and terrestrial and  ocean ecosystems through supply of limiting nutrients such as iron and phosphorus.  In addition to  indirect impacts to society in the science disciplines above, there are direct societal impacts in populated  regions where mineral dust is a natural hazard that affects human health and safety      References    Atkinson, J., B.

Crop yields, ecosystem health, and carbon cycling substantially depend on ground-level ozone  concentrations because ozone enters plant stomata and oxidizes tissue, thereby inhibiting  photosynthesis and reducing stomatal conductance and carbon uptake [e.g., Reich and  Amundson, 1985]. Likewise, enhanced nitrogen deposition is a primary cause of biodiversity loss  [Bobbink et al., 2010] and can perturb carbon sequestration [Reay et al., 2008].  Satellite and  other measurements of ozone and NO2, which accounts for up to 1/3 of dry-deposited NOy,  show increasing concentrations in regions with large populations and significant biomass such as  India, East Asia, and Africa.  Levels of these pollutants are expected to continue to increase due  to industrialization, population growth in conjunction with increased energy use per capita, and  expansion of agricultural burning. Their impact on crop health (and thus food security) and  ecosystems and the subsequent changes in carbon uptake are highly uncertain and represent a  key gap in our knowledge of the Earth system.  The challenge of understanding these  relationships was endorsed as a critical research and applications need by the GEO-CAPE  Atmospheric Science Working Group (ASWG) at a recent community workshop.  This ASWG  represents a broad cross-section of ~35 scientists from universities and government laboratories  who have contributed to pre-formulation studies for the air quality component of the GEO-CAPE  mission recommended by the 2007 Decadal Survey [http://geo-cape.larc.nasa.gov/].   Ozone has been shown to affect crop yields at concentrations as low as 40 ppb.  However, up- scaling site-level findings to the regional and ultimately global scale is extremely challenging and  fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless, studies show substantial global economic consequences  of ozone-induced crop damage, exceeding tens of billions of dollars annually [e.g. Wang and  Mauzerall, 2004]. For example, Ghude et al. [2014] find that up to 9% of the Indian cereal crop,  enough to feed over 94 million people, is lost due to ground-level ozone. Furthermore, Sitch et  al. [2007] predict that the expected increase in ozone concentrations over the next century  could reduce carbon uptake by plants to the extent that the resulting indirect radiative forcing  would be as large as the direct forcing from tropospheric ozone.  Reay et al. [2008], on the other  hand, find that large increases in nitrogen deposition to both northern and tropical forests over  the next few decades could help to sequester up to 10% of annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions,  but note that the caveats to the numerous extrapolations used to calculate the result are  “legion”.  Reflecting in part the large uncertainties and potentially serious consequences of the  impacts of changes in atmospheric composition on the terrestrial biosphere, the World Climate  Research Programme recently endorsed “Biogeochemical forcings and feedbacks” as a Theme of  Collaboration, similar in scope to the Grand Challenges.   Key questions that must be addressed to reduce these uncertainties are:   1. What controls near-surface ozone and NO2 concentrations, particularly in tropical  regions with large biomass concentrations?     2. What is the relationship between crop and ecosystem health and near-surface ozone  and NO2 levels across a range of vegetation types?   3. How does gross primary production, and thus carbon uptake, vary with surface ozone  and NO2 concentrations and deposition?     Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?  This is a critical time to address the issue of air quality impacts on crop and ecosystem health,  given the expected rapid changes in ozone and NO2 from changes in land use, population  growth, and industrialization over the next several decades that threaten food security and may  significantly impact terrestrial carbon uptake. There has been much progress in recent years  toward using satellite data to quantify ozone pre-cursor emissions.  Studies have successfully  related changes in these precursors to changes in tropospheric ozone [e.g., Verstraeten et al.,  2015] and shown that these data can be combined with models to place constraints on near- surface ozone, particularly when augmented with in situ measurements [e.g. Huang et al. 2015].   New multispectral retrievals demonstrate the capability to directly measure near-surface ozone  from space using a combination of reflected sunlight in the ultraviolet and visible with thermal  IR radiances [e.g., Worden et al., 2007; Natraj et al., 2011; Worden et al., 2010] and the first  satellite-based estimate of global NO2 dry deposition has recently been produced [Nowlan et al.,  2014].  Our ability to use satellite measurements to understand the links between precursor  emissions and near-surface ozone is expected to grow even more with the launch of the  upcoming geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) missions TEMPO (NASA), GEMS (KARI), and Sentinel-4  (ESA), but assessing the impacts of air pollution on crops and ecosystems will continue to  require massive extrapolation of site-level relationships between atmospheric concentrations  and changes in plant physiology.  At the same time, our ability to gauge ecosystem health from space is growing rapidly. New  measurements of photosynthesis using plant fluorescence in the near IR have been used to  provide constraints on global and regional gross primary production [e.g., Frankenberg et al.,  2011; Guanter et al., 2014].  The Earth Venture ECOSTRESS instrument will measure water  stress, a potentially confounding factor with physiological effects similar to those of air  pollution. Hyperspectral visible light measurements have been shown to provide key insights  into vegetation health, including chlorophyll abundance and leaf relative water content [e.g.,  Treitz and Howarth, 1999].  New collocated CO2 and fluorescence measurements from OCO-2  are advancing our understanding of the links between GPP, respiration, and carbon cycling.   Currently, however, there is no way to relate any of these measurements to ozone and NO2  concentrations with the spatial and temporal resolution required to understand the relationship  between air quality and ecosystem health.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  While ground-based measurements have been key to understanding that ozone and NO2  negatively affect plants and therefore impact carbon cycling, only a space-based observing  strategy can provide the large numbers of measurements with high spatiotemporal resolution  and regional or global coverage required to characterize the sources and transport of these  pollutants and quantify their effects on different biomes in different regions.  At the same time,  aircraft and ground-based observations of CO2 (such as those from FLUXNET), ozone, NO2, and  plant biomarkers will be critical to establish relationships between, for example, ozone     concentrations and deposition rates and between plant damage and carbon uptake that can be  used to calibrate and interpret the satellite measurements.  The new Decadal Survey offers the opportunity to develop a new satellite or system of satellites  that measures the relationships between air quality and ecosystem function in an integrated  way at the relevant scales required to address the fundamental yet unresolved science  questions described above.  While the technologies for the needed measurements are mature,  the exact measurement requirements for such a mission (e.g. spatiotemporal resolution and  precision) are not currently well-understood.  Strong diurnal cycles in pollutant concentrations,  stomatal conductance, and photosynthesis as well as high spatial variability in vegetation type  and ozone and NO2 abundance suggest a need for multiple measurements per day with  contiguous mapping at scales of a few kilometers or less.  These types of measurements are  most easily accomplished from a GEO viewpoint, and would enable understanding of how  pollution plumes are transported to and adsorbed by vegetation, how different biomes and  crops respond to this pollution, and how these responses change their carbon uptake and  ultimately atmospheric CO2 abundances. Studies using ground networks, aircraft data, and  regional and global models along with Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) will  be required in advance of space-based measurements, however, to ensure that measurement  requirements are established that will allow the satellite measurements to be exploited to their  full potential.  The NASA DISCOVER-AQ aircraft mission, which focused on air quality and helped  to establish measurement requirements for GEO-CAPE, provides a blueprint for such studies.  The suite of instruments from DISCOVER-AQ could be augmented with recently-developed  airborne imaging spectrometers that measure plant fluorescence and visible imagers that  measure biological markers of vegetation health to advance the scientific state-of-the-art with  respect to characterizing the linkages between air quality, crop and ecosystem health, and  carbon cycling.   An intriguing option that should be explored by the OSSE studies is a demonstration mission on  the International Space Station.  OCO-3 could potentially be timed to overlap with ECOSTRESS to  provide a fairly comprehensive ecosystem mission.  Additional air quality measurements from  the same platform would provide the entire suite of concurrent measurements, though it is  unclear whether the spatiotemporal resolution of the observations would be sufficient to  provide substantial improvement in our understanding.      Given that much of the expected growth in emissions and most of the biomass occur in the  tropics and subtropics, there is much to be gained from an ecosystem mission flying  concurrently with a proposed air quality mission over these latitudes (see companion white  paper on the “Future of Air Quality in the Developing World”), but measurements over any  region would serve a wide range of science communities, including those interested in  atmospheric composition and air-quality, ecosystem health and change, and the carbon cycle.   The science would supply critical information to policy makers around the world concerned with  food security, which can have enormous economic and political consequences not only  regionally but globally.

Seto, Miguel Román, Riley Duren  The importance of cities The development of cities represents one of largest perturbations to the global carbon cycle. By 2100, the globe’s urban population is expected to reach 8.5 billion, and recent estimates suggest that urban areas globally will nearly triple in size during the first three decades of the 21st century. Though only accounting for less than 3% of the land surface, urban areas account for 70% of the energy-related CO2 emissions globally and if one considers the carbon associated with both energy and materials, the share is even larger. Furthermore, the distribution of emissions within and across cities is logarithmic, with a few very large magacities dominating the urban share.  Why are urban emissions important? The impact on the global carbon cycle from this rapidly increasing anthropogenic component is illuminated by the inverse problem, a key strategy to understand the global carbon cycle. For many years the science community has been studying the uncertainty associated with feedbacks between global climate change and land/ocean carbon uptake (White Paper by Schimel et al. – “Carbon and Climate”). Within that context, anthropogenic emissions, particularly the fossil fuel combustion component (FFCO2), are typically used as a near-certain boundary condition in assessing total carbon budgets. It has been shown that errors in the location, timing, or magnitude of FFCO2 fluxes can be transferred onto the remaining flux components of carbon inversion studies. Though traditionally considered well-quantified at the global scale (6-10% error), this error is increasing. More importantly, uncertainty at the spatial scale of individual cities range from 50 to 100% with CH4 uncertainties equally large at all spatial scales. It is precisely at these smaller space and time scales that mechanistic knowledge of land-atmosphere exchange operates. The large uncertainty associated with urban carbon emissions is due, in large measure, to the relative dearth of systematic, comprehensive, scientifically driven data collection at the urban scale. Emissions monitoring data that have been collected for regulatory or economic purposes are often incomplete or rarely checked against scientific standards and procedures. These problems result in significant space/time scale gaps (between facility- and national-level emissions) and sectoral gaps in understanding.  There are equally important practical ends to better understanding urban carbon emissions. It has become clear that climate policy emerging at the local levels is taking on global importance. For example, over 1000 mayors have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, which commits them to meeting or exceeding the Kyoto Protocol reductions within their cities. Cities remain critical participants in the implementation of climate policy because the urban landscape is where the majority of industry operates, consumers live, and power is consumed. It is at the municipal scale that knowledge about local mitigation options, costs, and opportunities is the greatest. The recent attention on urban climate policy, in turn, has placed growing emphasis on understanding and quantifying current urban carbon flows (Fig. 1) and their potential responses to policy. Quantifying baseline emissions, planning emission mitigation efforts, and assessing progress towards climate mitigation targets all require improved monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) at the urban scale.  Fig. 1: Urban carbon budget schematic with urban carbon reservoirs (colored boxes), carbon fluxes (blue block arrows), drivers (rounded rectangles) and process linkage examples (colored thin arrows).  Urban carbon monitoring requirements Meeting the scientific challenges and emerging policy needs requires mapping FFCO2 emissions to finer scales in space and time, reflecting the human dimensions at which carbon is emitted. The density of cities requires flux resolution in the range of 1 km or better. Additionally, confident detection and attribution of major point sources and understanding urban-scale processes often requires additional functional information at the scale of individual buildings, road ways, parks, land-fills, natural gas storage facilities, pipelines, factories and power plants. Furthermore, the complexity and transboundary aspects of the urban carbon cycle demands improved spatial and temporal mapping of urban processes that often extends well beyond the traditional administrative boundaries (Fig. 1). Remote sensing combined with new ground-based data and modeling can achieve granular representation of carbon flows and their drivers.  Current efforts and limitations Scientists are starting to meet the challenges arising from city-based carbon monitoring efforts. In the past five years, 'bottom-up' estimations of carbon emissions from fuel reporting, traffic data, building information and human activity (Fig. 2) are being merged with urban scale 'top-down' atmospheric measurements of CO2, methane, carbon monoxide and 14CO2 — an isotope of CO2 that reflects fuel combustion. Such efforts have been underway over the past several years in Paris and in the US cities of Indianapolis, Boston, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles (Fig. 3); more are planned for São Paulo, Brazil, and cities in Australia, China, the United Kingdom and Canada. Each of these pilot project typically requires a few millions dollars to establish (exclusive of remote-sensing platforms), and often involve at least a dozen surface monitoring sites and analysis of remotely sensed data and modelling efforts. Scaling these pilot efforts to thousands of cities around the world including the developing world is not practical; hence satellite observations will pay a critical role in filling observational gaps.   Fig. 2. A visualization of carbon dioxide emissions data from Marion County, Indiana, shows that large buildings and main roads (red areas) emit the most     Fig. 3: The Megacities Carbon Project in Los Angeles and other pilot projects are using surface, aircraft and satellite observations to estimate carbon fluxes and study key emission sectors (Credit: JPL/Caltech) What could be done from space? Satellite observations are needed to complement the growing but still very sparse surface-based greenhouse gas monitoring networks with observations over regional scales, providing boundary conditions to urban scale inverse frameworks as well as insight into trans-boundary (remote) fluxes. Satellites are fundamental to reducing flux uncertainties at the required fine spatial scales given their ability to provide dense sampling and broad coverage spanning thousands of priority areas distributed over most continents. Future satellites with persistent observations and small pixel scales have the potential to overcome fundamental challenges in sample density that currently limit the utility of flux inversions. Satellites are also essential for filling large gaps in bottom-up emission process understanding – particularly in developing, data-poor cities – where satellites can provide information through proxies such as nightlights and land surface imaging. The recent development of science-quality nighttime environmental products at high temporal resolution (such as VIIRS – cf., Fig. 4) is an example of how global land science products can be used to systemically monitor human activity patterns. A new generation of long term consistent data records that go beyond the traditional suite of land climate variables is needed to provide the necessary insights to further promote low carbon and sustainable development in cities and urban-rural areas.  Fig. 4: Nighttime environmental products from Suomi-NPP VIIRS serve as a good descriptor of urban function – i.e., the economic, mobility, informational, and operational connections between urban cores and outside areas Recent improvements in greenhouse gas remote sensing technology are beginning to offer the surface sensivity and spatial resolution required for urban studies. Japan's GOSAT has demonstrated in a few representative cases that spaceborne CO2 measurements can constrain the 'domes' of the gas that lie above cities. This work is continuing with NASA's OCO-2, which launched in July 2014. None of the existing greenhouse gas measuring satellites have the spatial or temporal coverage required to study more than a few dozen cities. OCO-3, planned for deployment on the International Space Station in 2018 will have a 'city mode' that can monitor up to 80% of the world’s FFCO2 emissions from cities and power plants with at least seasonal revisit. The European Space Agency's Sentinel-5 mission (to launch in 2016) should provide near-global measurements of large methane emitters on the urban scale every few weeks (although the TROPOMI instrument’s 7 km spatial resolution is too coarse for many urban scale studies).  Newly developed remote-sensing technology offers the measurement precision, high spatial resolution, near-continuous mapping and rapid revisit times required for robust monitoring of cities. Three such instruments deployed on geostationary satellites (one each over the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia) would provide simultaneous measurements of carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide column-averaged mixing ratios for the majority of the Earth’s populated land surface, including nearly every major urban area and power plants. What could this do?  High-resolution monitoring of atmospheric constituents from space, combined with new techniques characterizing carbon fluxes within and across cities could provide a critical constraint to carbon inverse and carbon budget studies, better characterize carbon stocks influenced by cities, and provide much-needed quantification of urban FFCO2 emissions for both the verification and mitigation guidance problems. The use of remote sensing technology has another role to play within this stragetic vision – characterization of emitting infrastructure or “activity” in much of the world where there is no “bottom-up” complement, such as in the United States, could prove crucial to building out urban information systems in those parts of the world where rapid urbanization is anticipated in the coming decades. The combination of techniques – remote sensing CO2 concentration, ground-based models and data using traditional and new (“big data”, crowd-sourcing), remote sensing of “activity” – could deliver new scientific knowledge to carbon cycle science and urban science in addition to practical policy needs.

While ground-based measurements have been key to understanding that ozone and NO2  negatively affect plants and therefore impact carbon cycling, only a space-based observing  strategy can provide the large numbers of measurements with high spatiotemporal resolution  and regional or global coverage required to characterize the sources and transport of these  pollutants and quantify their effects on different biomes in different regions.  At the same time,  aircraft and ground-based observations of CO2 (such as those from FLUXNET), ozone, NO2, and  plant biomarkers will be critical to establish relationships between, for example, ozone     concentrations and deposition rates and between plant damage and carbon uptake that can be  used to calibrate and interpret the satellite measurements.  The new Decadal Survey offers the opportunity to develop a new satellite or system of satellites  that measures the relationships between air quality and ecosystem function in an integrated  way at the relevant scales required to address the fundamental yet unresolved science  questions described above.  While the technologies for the needed measurements are mature,  the exact measurement requirements for such a mission (e.g. spatiotemporal resolution and  precision) are not currently well-understood.  Strong diurnal cycles in pollutant concentrations,  stomatal conductance, and photosynthesis as well as high spatial variability in vegetation type  and ozone and NO2 abundance suggest a need for multiple measurements per day with  contiguous mapping at scales of a few kilometers or less.  These types of measurements are  most easily accomplished from a GEO viewpoint, and would enable understanding of how  pollution plumes are transported to and adsorbed by vegetation, how different biomes and  crops respond to this pollution, and how these responses change their carbon uptake and  ultimately atmospheric CO2 abundances. Studies using ground networks, aircraft data, and  regional and global models along with Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) will  be required in advance of space-based measurements, however, to ensure that measurement  requirements are established that will allow the satellite measurements to be exploited to their  full potential.  The NASA DISCOVER-AQ aircraft mission, which focused on air quality and helped  to establish measurement requirements for GEO-CAPE, provides a blueprint for such studies.  The suite of instruments from DISCOVER-AQ could be augmented with recently-developed  airborne imaging spectrometers that measure plant fluorescence and visible imagers that  measure biological markers of vegetation health to advance the scientific state-of-the-art with  respect to characterizing the linkages between air quality, crop and ecosystem health, and  carbon cycling.   An intriguing option that should be explored by the OSSE studies is a demonstration mission on  the International Space Station.  OCO-3 could potentially be timed to overlap with ECOSTRESS to  provide a fairly comprehensive ecosystem mission.  Additional air quality measurements from  the same platform would provide the entire suite of concurrent measurements, though it is  unclear whether the spatiotemporal resolution of the observations would be sufficient to  provide substantial improvement in our understanding.      Given that much of the expected growth in emissions and most of the biomass occur in the  tropics and subtropics, there is much to be gained from an ecosystem mission flying  concurrently with a proposed air quality mission over these latitudes (see companion white  paper on the “Future of Air Quality in the Developing World”), but measurements over any  region would serve a wide range of science communities, including those interested in  atmospheric composition and air-quality, ecosystem health and change, and the carbon cycle.   The science would supply critical information to policy makers around the world concerned with  food security, which can have enormous economic and political consequences not only  regionally but globally.

Mannucci Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology  Key Challenges and Needs: The modeled climate sensitivity (CS), defined to be the global annual-mean surface temperature change in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 relative to its pre-industrial value, ranges roughly between 1.5 to 5.0o C having a highly asymmetric probability density function with large tails towards higher temperatures. Although its lower limit may be well defined, there is an uncomfortably large possibility of CS values > 4.5 oC [e.g., Tanaka et al., 2009]. This large spread, derived from climate models, arises primarily due to differences in how each model treats the low–altitude cloud feedback; yet, the reason for these discrepancies is not yet understood [Sherwood et al., 2014]. Additionally, the water vapor feedback is the largest positive feedback in all climate models [Soden and Held, 2006], but the relationship between moist convection and water vapor is not well represented in climate models [e.g., Sherwood et al., 2004; Dai, 2006]. Space–based measurements are key to address the above limitations. Monitoring water vapor’s three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution globally is one of the greatest challenges facing Earth sciences today [Trenberth et al., 2009]. This is because water vapor varies by three orders of magnitude from the surface up to the tropopause region. Ground-based platforms, reanalyses, and models do not provide precise knowledge of its concentration in many parts of the Earth’s atmosphere or its trends over time [Sherwood et al., 2010]. Poor vertical resolution measurements (IR and MW: 2–3 km) cannot capture its vertical variability leading to mis-modeling of the boundary layer’s moisture budget, introducing errors in the middle troposphere convection [Hannay et al., 2009] and low–altitude cloud and water vapor feedbacks. Consequently, Earth Sciences urgently need high quality satellite observations that provide high vertical resolution measurements continuously monitoring the water vapor climatology globally and under all weather conditions. Measuring the water vapor climatology and its drivers is a large fraction of Earth science activities that are directly related to climate change. Understanding the underlying physical processes that drive the global distribution of clouds and water vapor will reduce the climate feedbacks’ uncertainty. Observationally constraining these uncertainties will vastly improve our understanding of climate change. Improving model fidelity in matching observations is a viable path forward to narrowing the range of CS estimates and better predicting future trends. Should an observational focus on quantifying CS not be adopted, advancements in climate research will be delayed. Capturing the small-scale vertical structure of water vapor is an excellent long–term plan, because it will greatly advance our knowledge in modeling convection, subsidence/entrainment, boundary layer moisture, low–altitude cloud feedback, and upper troposphere water vapor feedback. Currently, IR and MW sounders provide only a 2–3 km vertical resolution. It is high time for Earth Sciences to focus on improving vertical resolution by adopting a multi–disciplinary and multi–platform approach by means of blending the right observational systems that measure thermodynamic variables over the oceans, land and atmosphere. Our understanding is sufficient to identify the major limitations to CS, but our current observational systems so far do not produce adequate constraints.  Timeliness: In 2006 a GNSS radio occultation (GPSRO) constellation was launched – COSMIC – whose products are used in a wide range of atmospheric science applications such as weather forecast improvements, hurricane research, stratospheric temperature trends, and boundary layer meteorology [Mannucci et al., 2014]. GNSS RO observations offer refractive index profiles with unparalleled vertical resolution (~ 100 m), which contain temperature and water vapor information. Following on the success of COSMIC, in late 2016, another GNSS RO constellation will be launched offering even better quality refractive index profiles lower within the boundary layer, from which water vapor profiles can be retrieved. This fosters the perfect opportunity for the science community to begin exploiting the availability of such a wealth of high vertical resolution space–based observations.    Why Space? Despite the availability of ground–based networks and campaigns, reanalyses, and models, without the availability of satellite observations there is no uniform sampling of the Earth’s atmosphere continuously globally. In particular, Yang et al. [2013] highlight the significance of using remote sensing observations to characterize processes and spatio–temporal states of the atmosphere, which have not been captured by climate models and conventional observing systems. Additionally, numerous authors try to estimate climate feedbacks using NASA’s A–Train low Earth orbiters (LEO) such as, AIRS [Gordon et al., 2013], MLS [Dessler et al., 2013], as well as NASA’s MERRA reanalysis [Dessler, 2013] to constrain the modeled feedbacks. Such efforts speak volumes about the importance of having space–based platforms to advance our current knowledge on climate change.  Responses to the Questions:  a. Is there a capability gap? The current capability gap in the Earth science community lies in the unavailability of high vertical resolution temperature and water vapor profiles globally and under all weather conditions. Understanding the Earth’s climate trends requires carefully integrated approaches that make maximum use of all available resources, not only for better predictions of future impacts, but also for better understanding of past and current observations. Should high vertical resolution thermodynamic atmospheric properties be meticulously blended with existing high horizontal resolution data sets, unique gridded products can be realized that can potentially observe atmospheric processes that are relevant to climate but have eluded study. In this context, and also in the context of planning and designing next-generation remote sensors to accommodate future observing requirements, high vertical resolution profiles and the development of mathematical methods for data fusion and optimal synthesis of present-day observations is a critically important need. Thus, Earth Sciences should explore multi–platform sounders, welcoming the use of complementary data products to successfully mitigate the emerging demands of climate change. This cannot happen without investments in new observing tools that span new regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., GNSS – Radio Occultations) currently underused for meeting Earth System Science objectives. b. Linking space-based observations with other observations. For example, the development of techniques to combine NASA’s A–Train space–based observations with GNSS RO signals for the retrieval of high spatial resolution global products is already underway. Such techniques are central to climate change research. c. Scientific and societal benefits. Easterling et al. [2000] discuss in detail how a change in climate increases the occurrence frequency of extreme weather events, while Knuttson et al. [2010] show that hurricane intensity will shift towards stronger categories in a warming climate. Evidently, better understanding CS is critical to devising strategic plans that help society evade future catastrophes with potentially high economic impact. For example, without the use of remote sensing observations, a hurricane cannot be “sensed” until it hits ground. Satellite observations can detect such events in advance and National Centers can announce forecasts to prepare the society. d. The science communities that would be involved. The science communities that would be involved in this goal are the GNSS radio occultation community, the climate modeling community, and scientists from tropospheric and stratospheric dynamics community. Here, we emphasize on the multi–disciplinary nature of CS bridging the modeling and observational communities. Testing the validity of a theory requires high quality observations, and this is the reason why we emphasize on the vertical structure of the water vapor profiles – because currently there are no space–based observing systems with the superior resolution of radiosondes (which are limited to coverage over land).

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the  coming decade?   As the effects of climate change become more pronounced, it becomes critical to   understand the influence of atmospheric constituents on Earth’s energy budget. These   include methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the two anthropogenic greenhouse   gases most important to climate change. For both gasses, the majority of anthropogenic   emissions are emitted from concentrated point sources. These emissions are expected   to continue rising and their impacts are significant. Although the cause of increased   atmospheric CH4 remains unclear, CH4 is an important source of ozone production and   photochemical smog. Water vapor (H2O) contributes around 60% of the Earth’s   greenhouse gas warming effect and concentrations will increase with rising global   temperatures. Volcanic sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions affect human, animal, and plant   health and can result in aerosols, which represent the largest uncertainty in the global   energy budget.    2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?   Existing satellite sensors used to measure these atmospheric constituents are limited by   coarse spatial resolutions (i.e. kilometers). A spaceborne imaging spectrometer with a   spatial resolution of 30 m or less would provide coverage of large areas, resolve   individual point sources, and permit characterization of emissions at resolutions fine     enough to catalog the most important point sources. This includes attribution of   natural/anthropogenic emissions to regions of increasing concern like megacities (CH4,   CO2, aerosols) and oil/gas fields (CH4), both projected to grow in size and number.   Many source categories of anthropogenic emissions are underestimated and represent   effective targets for mitigation. Individual point sources would also be characterized,   including emissions from energy production like power plants (CO2), and from natural   sources such as volcanos (SO2, aerosols). Imaging spectrometers are particularly well   suited because adjacent pixels within scenes are acquired nearly instantaneously,   thereby providing spatial context important in interpreting results. In addition to direct   attribution to individual point source locations, these measurements will permit emission   flux estimates of both point and regional emission sources. High spatial resolution water   vapor maps would allow quantification of evapotranspiration from agriculture and natural   vegetation, understanding of sub-scale variability relevant to weather and climate   models, and fine scale characterization of cloud properties as they relate to radiative   forcing.   3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?   Given the global distribution and great number of point sources like megacities, oil/gas  fields, power plants, and volcanos, space-based observations are an effective method  for characterizing emissions from these sources. While airborne imaging spectrometers  have been used in the past, mapping large regions by aircraft is challenging given  limited access to airspace and the high cost of airborne campaigns (particularly if repeat  coverage is required). A satellite with a revisit time of 16 days or less would permit  baseline measurements and enable statistically robust sampling to track variations with  time (i.e. growth rate, assessing questions of persistent versus intermittence).   a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the  capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and  associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?   Existing and planned U.S. and international satellite missions are limited by coarse  spatial resolutions (5x5 km2) or a narrow swath (less than 20 km). For example, CO2  measurements have 2x2 km2 spatial resolution with a swath less than 20 km (OCO-2,  OCO-3, and TanSat), while CH4 measurements will have the coarser resolution of 7x7  km2 with a swath greater than 2,000 km (Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-5). A spaceborne  imaging spectrometer designed with the right balance of  spectral, spatial (30 m or less),  and temporal (revisit time of 16 days or less) resolution requirements would resolve  individual point sources within scenes and offer the ability to track emission sources  over time.         b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value  of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs;   These high spatial/temporal resolution records could be compared directly with   additional satellite measurements obtained at coarser spatial resolutions (i.e.   atmospheric sounders). In addition, results from airborne imaging spectrometers could   be used to validate satellite measurements of atmospheric constituents from point   sources and regions of interest like megacities or oil/gas fields. Finally, in situ airborne   or ground based measurements (tower networks) could be used to validate flux   estimates derived from satellite measurements.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and   By improving our understanding of Earth’s energy budget, carbon cycling, greenhouse   gas budgets, as well as permitting identification and mitigation of emissions sources,   these measurements would have significant scientific and societal benefits with   relevance to policy makers and regulators. These measurements are the best way to   enable a comprehensive global catalog of trace gas emissions; they are timely and   important to the health of the Earth and its inhabitants. In addition, it is important to   understand how rising temperatures and increasing concentrations of the greenhouse   gas water vapor will effect global radiative forcing. Quantification of evapotranspiration   from agriculture and natural vegetation has implications for a future where freshwater is   scarcer, while an improved understanding of cloud properties and water vapor could   improve weather forecasts and climate models. Characterization of volcanic SO2   emissions are important not only because they have immediate effects on health, but   volcanic eruptions have lasting effects on the environment, climate, and the economy. A   greater understanding of the influence of aerosols is of particular importance given they   represent the largest uncertainty in the global energy budget.    d. The science communities that would be involved.   These measurements would provide a unique dataset critical to understanding the   influence of atmospheric constituents on Earth’s energy budget. This spans the   atmospheric, climate, modelling, carbon cycle, and natural hazards scientific   communities. In addition, water vapor and cloud data at this unprecedented spatial   resolution (30 m or less) would be particularly relevant for weather and climate   modelers. Given potential application towards informing mitigation strategies, regulatory   approaches, and policy development, involvement would also include the   environmental, political, and economic science communities.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic re-  search, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?      One of the greatest consequences of our warming climate will likely be related to changes in the hy-  drologic cycle and general circulation.  Droughts, floods, and severe storms have enormous impacts on   society.   Both the hydrological cycle and general circulation are driven by exchanges of moisture, mo-  mentum, and energy between the world’s oceans and atmosphere.  This air-sea interaction is one of the   most important and the least understood mechanisms of the climate system.  Reliable observational   quantification of these fluxes – and their accurate portrayal in climate models – is a major scientific chal-  lenge.     The dynamics of the air-sea boundary layer are characterized by a set of climate variables that   change in a correlated manner on timescales ranging from hours to decades.  On short time scales,   there are the hourly life-cycles of mesoscale convective systems.  On longer time scales, there are the   intra-seasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation, the inter-annual El Niño/Southern Oscillation, and the decadal   oscillations observed in the large ocean basins. To understand climate change, it is essential that scien-  tists have accurate measurements of the complete array of air-sea climate variables on this full range of   timescales.   A number of the air-sea climate variables can be simultaneously measured using satellite microwave   (MW) sensor technology. These variables include sea-surface temperature (SST) and wind stress, near-  surface vector winds, and atmospheric moisture in the form of vapor, clouds, and rain.  Climate data   records (CDR) for these air-sea variables, going back 2 to 3 decades (depending on variable), have been   constructed by merging together MW observations from a diverse set of satellites, some of which were   never intended to be used as climate sensors.  The existing air-sea CDRs have been used by literally   thousands of scientists for a variety of different purposes, including model evaluation, studies of natural   internal variability, and anthropogenic signal detection. Such research has been a central part of the re-  cent IPCC Assessments. The grand challenge for the future is to continue observations of these tempera-  ture, moisture, and circulation variables in a better and more systematic manner than the patchwork   approach employed in the past. For reliable quantification of future climate change, it is imperative to   continue these observations in an affordable and sustainable manner. This will require the development   of low-cost MW sensor technology and launch systems.         2.  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?      The existing programs and plans for continuing the record of air-sea climate variables are inade-  quate.  The measurement of global SST requires a MW channel near 7 GHz.  The only two satellite sen-  sors currently operating at this low frequency are NRL’s WindSat and JAXA’s AMSR-2.  There are no   planned follow-ons for either sensor, and WindSat is near its end-of-life.  Inferring SST with infrared   technology is impeded by contamination from clouds, aerosols, and water vapor.  In contrast, MW   measurements can easily see through thick layers of clouds and are essentially unaffected by water va-  por and aerosols.  NASA’s GPM program flies a single MW imager called GMI.  The lowest GMI frequency   is 11 GHz, which does allow for SST retrievals in warm water (about half of the oceans), but GMI has no   vector wind capability.  Plans for a GMI follow-on are uncertain.   EUMETSAT MetOp satellites carry a C-band MW scatterometer, ASCAT, that measures vector winds   and stress.  There is no accompanying radiometer for measuring other air-sea variables.  MetOp-A and -  B are in nearly the same sun-synchronous orbit and hence have limited (12 hour) diurnal information.    The EUMETSAT 2nd Generation MetOp satellites will carry a microwave imager, but this sensor will not   have the lower frequency channels necessary for SST, accurate winds, and intense precipitation.   In the coming year, ISRO plans to launch the Ku-band scatterometer ScatSat, which will be followed   by OSCAT2 in 2018-19.  However, there is no accompanying MW radiometer with the full channel set   necessary for measuring the complete array of climate variables.      3.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?      Improving scientific understanding of the nature and causes of climate change requires a complete   and continuous picture of the dynamics of the air-sea variables. In turn, this requires global data cover-  age over all time scales mentioned above.      In situ observations are too sparse to provide the spatial-temporal detail needed.  Additionally, a   number of air-sea variables are either poorly measured or not measured at all by in situ instrumenta-  tion. In contrast, space-based sensor technology is extremely stable (in most cases), and can provide   both global and regional decadal trends to an accuracy unobtainable from in situ data.    Furthermore, regional trends differ substantially from the global mean trend, and have a much larg-  er impact than the global averaged trend. The interaction of these regional changes contributes to the   global trend and to regional trends.   This is not to say in situ measurements are unimportant.  They have always been used as the abso-  lute calibration reference for satellite retrievals, and this need for calibration will continue into the fu-  ture.  Measurements from various types of satellite sensors are also needed for inter-calibration and   validation activities.  Precision validation requires consistency from a large array of similar in situ and   satellite measurements.     The satellite sensor we envisage to meet future needs is a combined active-passive scatterome-  ter/radiometer, which will measure all the above mentioned air-sea variables simultaneously.  By flying   the sensor in an inclined orbit, the diurnal cycle of the climate variables can be resolved.  The combina-  tion of a C-band scatterometer and a multi-frequency polarimetric radiometer will, for the first time,   provide unique vector winds (i.e., no ambiguities) under all weather conditions.  The C-band scatterome-  ter diurnal measurements will complement the sun-synchronous C-band measurements taken by   MetOp’s ASCAT.  The observations obtained from this sensor would be a significant boon to oceanogra-  phy, meteorology, and climate research and would support a continuing climate record.  Additional op-  erational scenarios include flying multi-frequency polarimetric MW radiometers in the same orbits as   ASCAT and the ISRO scatterometers.

Challenges· Uncertainties in the level of carbon stored in forests and the changes in that level have a large impact on the uncertainty in future climate projection · Uncertainties in tropical-forest carbon dynamics are particularly important for their potential role in the missing carbon sink, and associated future climate scenarios · Spaceborne remote sensing of aboveground biomass is the only practical approach to measuring global carbon-cycle dynamics · In order to assess what investments are needed, it is proposed that the Decadal Survey take a broad look at all spaceborne interferometric microwave possibilities from P-band to Ka-band, and their combination with lidar and various spectral options.    A principal challenge for Earth System Science is the global monitoring of forest structure to enable aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring. Uncertainties in the level of carbon stored in forests and the changes in that level have a large impact on the uncertainty in future climate projection  (e.g. Schimel et al. 2015). Methods of monitoring AGB must address changes in stored carbon on scales germane to land use and logging (50-100 m).  They must cover the vegetated globe, especially the tropics, which accounts for about 50% of the world’s remaining terrestrial AGB.  The remote sensing of tropical-forest AGB will be a high priority in AGB-monitoring strategies. The amount of CO2 removed when a tropical stand is converted to agricultural use must be accurately measured, necessitating the measurement of a priori stock. Monitoring AGB must include accurate “change” measurements over many passes, which will be sensitive to slow rates of regrowth.  These slow rates bear on the question of the missing terrestrial carbon sink. The origin of this substantial component of missing carbon is largely unknown, and constitutes a major hole in our understanding of global carbon cycle dynamics. This sink is approximately 67% of the net atmospheric uptake (LeQuere et al 2013). Recent studies hypothesize that this land sink could be due to increased forest uptake in the mature tropics due to the well-known increases in atmospheric CO2 over the last century (Pan et al. 2011, Schimel et al. 2015). The next-generation of structure-AGB sensors must rise to the challenge of detecting AGB change on 50-100 m scales in the tropics, with heavy cloud cover, in order to quantify the spatio-temporal origin of the missing sink. Climate change mitigation efforts designed to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) will also require global, high spatial- and temporal-density AGB monitoring.   Direct gravity sensors in space, such as GRACE, are inadequate by orders of magnitude to measure the gravity signature of changing or accumulated AGB. Brightness, either optical or radar, is a good indicator of AGB only up to about 150 Mg/ha (e.g. Le Toan et al. 2004). Tropical forests have AGB well in excess of 150 Mg/ha, extending up to about 600 Mg/ha. The remote sensing of AGB has therefore been done most accurately by measuring some structural attribute of forests and correlating it with AGB. One challenge in AGB remote sensing via structure is to ascertain the best structural attributes from which to estimate AGB. There are a variety of attributes that have been used. For example, height (Drake et al. 2002, Dubayah et al. 2010) has been used to estimate AGB or AGB change with lidar. More complex structural attributes, such as the Fourier transform of the vertical profile of vegetation have been used with lidar and interferometric SAR (InSAR). One of the challenges for the Decadal Survey is therefore to ascertain, from published results and consultations, which set of structural attributes produce the most accurate AGB estimates. A subsequent challenge is to determine the optimal set of sensors, including lidar and InSAR, and their possible fusion with hyperspectral remote sensing.   2. Timeliness and Readiness  Pinning down the degree to which tropical forests are causing the missing sink might help to discriminate between the above and a competing hypothesis that northern hemisphere, temperate regrowth is causing the sink. Discriminating between these two hypotheses—tropical or northern origin—discriminates between future ecological trajectories. The “CO2-increase-tropical hypothesis” suggests a continuing sink, while the “northern regrowth hypothesis” could saturate and the sink could diminish. If this were to happen, greater atmospheric levels of CO2 might result in the future. A timely characterization of the sink is needed to understand future climate and to shape consequent REDD+ mitigation strategies.  Existing, primarily international missions define current technological readiness to monitor global AGB. The only dedicated two-spacecraft interferometer in space is TanDEM-X (X-band, InSAR, Germany), which has produced 10s of papers on forest structure and AGB  (e.g. Askne et al. 2015, Treuhaft et al. 2015). The technology of TanDEM-X makes it promising, though not confirmed, for making progress on the challenge of global monitoring. TanDEM-X has demonstrated that the technology to fly a 2-spacecraft interferometer, capable of measuring AGB on ~50-meter scales, exists. Other, possible future missions, which are similarly candidates to address the challenge above, are BIOMASS (P-band, polarimetry, repeat-track InSAR, Europe), NISAR (L-band, S-band, polarimetry, repeat-track InSAR, United States), TanDEM-L (L-band, InSAR, Germany), PALSAR-3 (L-band, InSAR, Japan) and SAOCOM (L-band, InSAR, Argentina). The repeat-track InSAR missions are single-spacecraft. All the others are dual-spacecraft programs. A lidar mission, GEDI (infrared, United States) will be mounted on the space station to sample structure and AGB at fine (25 m) resolution scales. These missions will all contribute to substantial progress on the challenge above of AGB monitoring. Each has limitations that could signal the need for additional investments. These limitations include the inaccuracy of repeat-track InSAR due to scene change between passes, low bandwidths and consequent poor resolution, and restricted regions of operation and sparse coverage.   Frequencies from P-band to X-band have shown reasonable performance for InSAR-based structure and AGB estimation. Along with “bandwidth”, the carrier frequency, polarization and various other parameters will have to be reviewed by the Decadal Survey to determine what additional investments in sensor (or multiple-sensor) capability are necessary. Combining the above technologies with hyperspectral observations or multi-spectral lidar should also be investigated by Decadal Survey committees. In this RFI, it is simply proposed to take a broad look at all radar interferometric possibilities from P-band to Ka-band, and their combination with lidar and various spectral options. For the most part, the technology is ready, but the technical assessment as to the optimal suite of sensors, and their specifications, must be a part of the Decadal Survey process.   3. The Need for Space-Based Observations to Address the Challenge  In a recent study in Brazil, a 60 x 20 km area was covered by TanDEM-X. A number of 1000-hectare samples of that area were covered by airborne lidar. Based on the 1000-hectare samples, it was determined that coverage of the entire area would take about 10-20 days of airborne survey. The area was covered in 9 seconds by TanDEM-X.  Disturbances occur on scales of 50 – 100 m, and occur in as little as a few weeks. In order to cover the entire vegetated globe at such fine spatial and temporal resolution, space-based instruments must be deployed. The broad scientific question of balancing global and regional carbon budgets can only be addressed from space with observations over many years. Beyond addressing regional and global concerns, the fine resolution and coverage enabled by space-based observations will benefit formulation of local mitigation strategies. They will also benefit local economies in their assessment of forest resources such as wood or chemical products that come from wood.   The science communities that would be engaged by space-based observations include carbon-cycle, remote sensing, and ecosystem scientists. Atmospheric and climate scientists similarly will be involved in using the end-products of space-based observations.   Askne, Jan I.

Key challenges for Earth System Science include accurate,  geographically detailed estimation of damage and risk resulting from disasters,  realistic physical models to test hypotheses of real world phenomena, and an  effective means to disseminate and deliver these results to both scientific and  disaster response end-users.     Figure 1. Land earthquakes ≥M6 1970 – present. Damaging earthquakes have occurred on  every populated continent   These challenges are timely to address now because rapid delivery of  information is critical for pre-event emergency planning and post-event recovery.  Realistic physical models are a key contribution to our understanding of the  underlying processes at hand. Identifying a clear path for delivering results, both  scientific and applied, is critical to reaching the broadest user communities.   M6–6.4 (408)  M6.5–6.9 (153)  M≥7 (92)      2   Space-based observations have been a fundamental tool for hazard research  and disaster response for decades. From events such as earthquakes and  tsunamis, floods, wildfires, storms and tornados, oil spills, drought, and many  others, satellite observations have been used to aid in identifying emergent and  cascading hazards, damage assessment and post-disaster recovery efforts.    The 2002 Solid Earth Science Working Group (SESWG) Report remains a  leading guiding document for the community. One of the two 2002 SESWG  Report Leading Solid Earth Questions is:   How is the Earth’s surface being transformed and how can such information  be used to predict future changes?   Two scientific questions from the report continue to drive earthquake hazard  analysis:   1. What is the nature of deformation at plate boundaries and what are the  implications for earthquake hazards?   2. What are the dynamics of the mantle and crust and how does the Earth’s  surface respond?   Earth Surface and Interior studies provide the basic understanding and data  products needed to inform the assessment, mitigation, and forecasting of natural  hazards, including phenomena such as earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, and  volcanic eruptions. In the case of earthquake hazard, realistic physical models  will enable analysis of the behavior of complex fault systems by comparison of  the results of these models with observed seismicity and geodetic imaging data  from GPS and InSAR. The results will improve the utility of using combined  models and data to estimate earthquake potential. Improved simulations will help  characterize the deformation associated with earthquakes, and help assess and  mitigate their associated hazard. Spaceborne observations provide data that are  necessary to validate models, but also provide synoptic, time-critical situational  awareness to responders and decision makers in a disaster.   New methods to advance research of geohazards using time-variable  observations with a combination of computer simulations and geodetic  observations for model validation are required to understand the complex nature  of fault interaction and plate boundary deformation. These models help to  enhance our understanding of the underlying processes and can further aid in  developing observation strategies for upcoming satellite missions seeking to  determine how faults interact.    Models will also help to characterize the behavior of fault systems and  interactions that will enable improvements in hazard estimation. Validating the  results against geodetic observations will allow us to better constrain the  rheology and fault properties, which helps with the overall understanding of  earthquake physics, fault interactions and earthquake hazard, preparedness and  risk reduction (Figure 2).      3     Figure 2 Left: Example benchmark validation fault model, 3D finite element mesh. Fault models  can have variable material properties and fault zone slip and properties. The inset shows a  zoomed-in view of the fault zone. Fault models can be increasingly complex, simulating tectonic  regions such as the Los Angeles Basin or other well-known plate boundary zones. Right:  Simulations are validated by observations of complex fault behavior, such as with UAVSAR in  California.   Existing international programs provide reasonable capability to advance these  challenges, but in order to make substantial improvements, dedicated US  satellite resources should be committed to improve observations, both to  enhance geohazard science and disaster response. The NASA-ISRO Synthetic  Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission will provide unprecedented coverage for solid  Earth hazards. Higher resolution imagery from airborne radar platforms would  complement spaceborne radar observations, providing cross track swaths.  Optical and topographic measurements would fill in details where radar  measurements might decorrelate and where geomorphic features provide  information about mechanical properties.  Fused measurements would better  constrain fault behavior and aid in response.   These particular challenges would focus on the Solid Earth community, but  would have relevance to the Applications and Disaster Risk Reduction  communities as well.

Wind and current coupling at the air/sea interface is extremely poorly known and  adversely impacts our understanding of large and small scale processes, including  those that impact regional economies    The air-sea interface is a critical link in the Earth’s climate system; incomplete knowledge of the  dynamics at this interface causes significant errors in the representation of horizontal and vertical  mass and heat transports in the upper ocean, and limits the accuracy of climate and seasonal forecast  models. Global surface currents are the most important and least directly observed ocean currents.   The global relation between the surface wind and the speed and direction of wind-driven surface  currents is unknown and unobserved. Theory and inferences from near-surface measurements  suggest that velocity differences comparable to the magnitude of the wind-driven current itself likely  often occur over the upper few meters of the ocean.      Evidence exists that near-surface currents due to momentum exchange between the ocean and the  atmosphere are substantially different from those inferred from existing, indirect observational  techniques, and that these differences have important implications for vertical and horizontal  transports of upper-ocean heat.  Theoretical differences are also substantial. The lack of  understanding of surface currents and their relation to surface winds limits our ability to represent in  predictive models such phenomena and processes as: meridional and zonal tropical heat transport;  equatorial currents and upwelling; ENSO and MJO dynamics; tropical eastern Pacific and Atlantic  sea-surface temperature and air-sea interaction, as well as dispersal of pollutants and floating marine  debris.      Wind-driven circulation accounts for much of the poleward heat transport by the ocean.  Vigorous air-sea exchanges of heat and carbon dioxide preferentially take place over upwelling  and western boundary regions because of wind-driven circulation. Through momentum and heat  fluxes, surface winds are a key variable mediating the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere.  The interaction gives rise to observed climate variability such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation  and is the physical basis for climate prediction. Scale interaction remains a challenge for  atmospheric and climate dynamics, with well documented upscale effects from meso-scale cloud  clusters to the planetary-scale intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The circulation of  the former is poorly sampled in time by existing satellite scatterometry. By exciting large- amplitude planetary-scale waves in the equatorial ocean, MJO affects the evolution of ENSO  events and is an important source of uncertainty in ENSO prediction (Chen et al. 2015;  McPhaden 2015).  Both ENSO and the MJO influence the likelihood of hurricanes forming.  Hurricanes can have a large impact on property and infrastructure. ENSO has a large impact on  interannual shifts in weather and hence large impacts on agriculture as well as aquaculture.        The upper ocean supports productive fisheries that are essential to the global economy, and  bears an increasing burden of human impacts, including pollutants associated with offshore  resource extraction and, in coastal regions, high-density economic development and at-sea  activity. Ocean surface currents and wind coupling are also important to the transport of ice and  melt water in high latitudes.  These Arctic wind and currents strongly influence the vertical and  horizontal heat transport in the Arctic Seas, and have been hypothesized to influence similar  transports in the North Atlantic Ocean. In all of these contexts and more, the role of the near- surface ocean is paramount: it supports the exchange of heat and dissolved gases with the  atmosphere, it supplies the primary biological productivity that drives fishery ecosystems, and it  determines the spread and fate of surface pollutants.  The vertical exchange of fluid and materials  between the near-surface (the uppermost 10-100 m of the water column) and the deeper ocean,  especially the systematic upwelling of nutrient-rich deeper waters into the upper ocean, strongly  affects the properties and dynamics of the near-surface ocean and upper ocean ecosystems.  Model-based assessments of near-surface/deep ocean vertical transports vary widely, in part  because they rely on relatively sparse measurements relative to the appropriate space and time  scales.     2.       Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect  to readiness?    With climate projected to warm, regional information on climate change is in high demand but  remains highly uncertain. A recent review identified the atmospheric circulation change as the  leading cause of the regional uncertainty (Xie et al. 2015). Measurement errors and large internal  variability prevent ship-based historical observations from providing strong constraints on  surface wind change (Tokinaga et al. 2012; L'Heureux et al. 2013). The decadal cooling of the  tropical Pacific, coupled with strengthened equatorial trade winds and temporarily slowing down  the global temperature increase, is a sober reminder of the complex interaction of anthropogenic  climate change and internal variability. Sustained, cross-calibrated global observations of surface  wind vectors from space are essential to reduce measurement and sampling errors and constrain  climate model projections regarding the atmospheric circulation change and the interaction with  the ocean.      Surface winds drive ocean circulation both locally through Ekman dynamics and remotely  through planetary waves. Both the local and remote mechanisms are at work in generating the  equatorial cold tongue, home to El Nino/Southern Oscillation. While satellite altimetry offers  global observations of planetary wave propagation and estimates of geostrophic current, surface  currents include a large ageostrophic component (especially in climatically important equatorial  oceans), and have never been observed globally from space. Concurrent observations of evolving  winds and currents will open new opportunities to study their interaction and three-dimensional  advective processes that generate sea surface temperature variability.     New technology exists (space-based microwave Doppler radar scatterometry) to address this  fundamental gap in the global ocean-atmosphere observing system. This new technology offers  the first opportunity to obtain the contemporaneous collocated global observations of surface winds  (or stress) and surface currents that are required to address these basic Earth science questions.    3.       Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these     challenges/questions?    Space-based observations are the most effective and perhaps the only way to obtain sufficient  spatial coverage observations of surface winds and surface currents. While the need for  measurements of surface currents has been recognized by space agencies (e.g., ESA) there has  yet to be a funded mission.  Several methods have been proposed to retrieve vector surface  currents, the most cost effective of which is a Doppler scatterometer. Such an instrument would  also simultaneously measure currents and surface winds, which would be highly advantageous.  Both the Indian and Japanese space agencies have expressed interest in collaborating with NASA  on activities related to such an instrument, to the extent of possibly covering the costs of a launch  vehicle, a satellite bus, and collaborating on antenna design, thus greatly reducing the cost of  such a mission.  The technology for such a mission has been developed, and surface observations  have been used to address the key technical questions: the investment that is still needed is  construction of the instrument and fostering of these collaborations.       The value of this investment will be multiplied by simultaneous spaced-based high-resolution  ocean topography and in-situ near-surface current and water property measurements from global  drifter and float arrays.  It could also be increased by placement in a satellite train that included  observations of microwave SST, microwave profilers (that can be used with scatterometers to  estimate surface turbulent fluxes), and observations of ocean color.    Anticipated benefits include new understanding of upper ocean dynamics and air-sea exchange  relevant to a broad array of ocean-atmosphere processes; improved climate, seasonal, and  weather forecasting models; improved practical prediction of pollutant dispersal and marine  debris, as well as improvement related to the coupled ocean/atmosphere system when coupled  with the instruments mentioned in the above paragraph.    Relevant science communities include physical oceanography, climate/seasonal/weather  forecasting and dynamics, biological & chemical oceanography, high latitude Arctic  oceanography and Southern Ocean oceanography. Operational communities from naval  operations, ship routing, weather and ocean forecasting, and climate forecasting  would gain a  great deal from a mission that included a Doppler scatterometer.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum  of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?    Climate change is well understood to be one of the major risks to modern society and one of the  greatest science challenges of this century (IPCC, 2013, USGCRP, 2014).  Yet we lack an  adequate observing system designed to address the joint societal/scientific challenges of climate  change (NRC, 2007; Trenberth et al., 2013; Dowell et al. 2013).  While we have a wide range of  Earth observations from surface to space, few have been designed to meet climate change  requirements.  No international agreements or commitments exist for designing, building, and  maintaining a climate observing system.  Yet the economic risks for climate change are  measured in trillions of dollars.  Given this challenge, can the Decadal Survey (hereafter simply  `Survey`) put forth a vision of the need, the objectives, the priorities, and the scope of such a  system?      A pair of recent research studies (Cooke et al. 2014; 2015) estimated the economic value of such  a system at ~ $10 trillion dollars to the world economy in today’s value (known as `net present  value` in economics and using a 3% discount rate).  In the simplest sense, this is the economic  value of moving climate science learning forward by 15 years using better observations, analysis,  and modeling/predictions.  The study further estimated that if the world tripled its current  economic investments in climate research (observations, analysis, modeling) to achieve such an  advanced observing system, the return on investment would be ~ $50 for every $1 invested by  society.  Few investments could approach such return.  Compare that message to the current  situation of a zero sum economic game in climate observations: one unresolved science question  struggles for funding against another; yet both are critical to achieve.  We need to change the  question from `Which critical science climate observation is more important?` to `What climate  science observations offer the highest value and return as a societal investment?`    Design of such an advanced and more rigorous international climate observing system would be  a challenge in itself.  Key elements of such a design can be taken from the recent NRC  Continuity report (2015) and include:        2  1. Define Quantified Earth Science Objectives (QESOs) for climate change.  Link their  solution to more rapid progress in climate change prediction, understanding and thereby  economic value through enabling improved societal decisions.  Rate the Importance of  the QESOs.  We expect QESOs to be closely aligned with the USGCRP research goals,  WCRP Grand Challenges, and IPCC major scientific uncertainties.  This task is well  suited to the Survey and its breadth of scientific expertise. Examples of QESOs can be  found in the NRC Continuity report.  Note that there will be many more highly important  QESOs than NASA/NOAA/USGS current budgets can provide.  This is exactly the point.   This is why we currently don't have a climate observing system.  We need to make clear  how large the step is from where we are to where we ultimately need to go.  The NRC  Continuity report’s proposed process can help with such selections.     2. Identify the key geophysical variables needed to address each QESO.  Since some  variables are more important than others, we must rate their relative Utility to achieving  the QESO.  While an evaluation of Utility has usually been performed qualitatively, only  quantitative analysis is able to lead to measurable rankings of the variables as discussed  in the NRC Continuity report (2015) and the NRC report on Quantifying Uncertainty in  Complex Models (2012).  The Survey could begin with qualitative discussion of Utility  rankings and recommend that NASA/NOAA/USGS develop quantitative methodologies  (e.g. OSSEs) for Utility ranking.     3. Quantify the Quality of the measurement needed to achieve the QESO.  Quality as  defined in the NRC Continuity report includes instrument accuracy, stability, time/space  sampling, algorithms, and data availability.  This task would require providing  quantitative analysis beyond the capability of the Survey process; but the Survey could  call for such analysis.     4. Quantify the success probability of the measurement.  This step includes consideration of  instrument risk (e.g. TRL level 6 vs 9), gap risk (and impact to Quality), and ability to  cover gaps at the required Quality using other observations (e.g. international missions).   This step is beyond the capability of the Survey to provide, but the Survey could call for  such analysis.      5. Estimate costs of the measurement approach.  This is a normal NASA/NOAA/USGS   process.     The Survey clearly cannot design a complete observing system as part of its process.  It can,  however, present the need, the vision forward, and show that a true climate observing system  would entail much larger resources than the current efforts by the U.S. or the international  community.  The Survey can also call for action to produce a more rigorous plan that might be  developed by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and its agencies.  This      3  vision cannot be produced by any of the current U.S. agencies, Congress, the Administration, or  the public.  It must come from the science community that best understands the magnitude of the  challenges.  The Survey and the USGCRP are the only two commissions capable of such a task  in the U.S.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?    While existing systems are incredibly valuable and cost effective, they are far below the  capabilities that even existing measurement technologies could achieve if applied to a climate  observing system optimized for cost/benefit.  Limits today are primarily economic and not  technological.  We struggle to achieve continuity of the observations we have already  demonstrated such as total solar irradiance, radiation budget, radio occultation for temperature,  cloud/aerosol lidar, cloud radar, precipitation radar, gravity for ice sheet mass, lidar for ice sheet  elevation, ocean color, etc.  In addition, a wide range of active remote sensing systems (e.g lidar,  radar) as well as much higher accuracy and information content passive sensors (e.g.  spectrometers) have been in technology development for 8 years since the last decadal survey  and many are ready to be utilized.  The 2007 Decadal Survey CLARREO benchmark climate  change mission is an excellent example.  CLARREO successfully passed Mission Concept  Review in late 2010, and has since been delayed for lack of NASA resources to implement the  concept.  Limited resources also greatly reduced activity on all of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 missions.    Space is expensive, but delaying climate change answers is much more expensive.      It is in this sense that an improved climate observing system is primarily a discussion of  investment value for society.  Urgency is needed as observation delays are especially  problematic given the long time scales of both climate change and societal policy actions.  The  Cooke et al (2015) study estimated a $650B per year cost to society for every year we delay an  advanced climate observing system.  At the same time, we must have a way to prioritize and  estimate cost/benefit of improvements if society is to invest in an improved climate observing  system as opposed to a zero sum game of `do the best you can`, while hoping for a miracle  breakthrough.  This approach has failed to significantly narrow uncertainty in climate sensitivity  even after 35 years of effort.  This can be seen by simply comparing the discussion of climate  sensitivity uncertainty in the Charney Report (NRC, 1979) to the recent IPCC AR5 (2013).  Even  more problematic, it remains unclear that the next 35 years of our current observations will solve  this key challenge (Wielicki et al. 2013, Trenberth et al. 2013).    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?    The primary logic for space observations is their unique ability to observe a wide range of  critical climate variables covering the entire global climate system,.  This is not to say that space  observations can do all observations.  In-situ (e.g. ARGO), aircraft (e.g. Ice Bridge), and surface  observations are essential as well.  But space observations are often the most complete and  rigorous observations for many critical global climate variables.         4  The difficulty of achieving an optimized climate observing system should not be underestimated.   One of the key challenges is coordination across disparate research communities with only  modest overlap.  These communities include surface/in-situ based climate observations, satellite  climate observations, climate modeling/projection science, economics of climate change impacts,  and climate policy.  The USGCRP is currently the only major U.S. organization charged with  such a broad charter, while internationally it is the World Climate Research Programme  (WCRP).  Ultimately a vision is required that can be effective at both national and international  levels.  The challenge is made more difficult by the fact that neither the USGCRP nor WCRP  control any significant budgetary resources, so their influence (like the NRC studies) must be  through providing a clear science vision to society.     The primary mission of this Decadal Survey is to recommend to NASA/NOAA/USGS a portfolio  that fits within its current budget.  But the secondary goal should be to provide the scientific  down payment on the longer-term vision of a true national and international climate observing  system.      References     Cooke, R., B. A.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum  of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?    The uncertainty range for climate sensitivity has not changed significantly since the 1979 NRC  Charney report on climate change.  In the forward to that report, Vern Suomi wrote about climate  change `In order to address this question in its entirety, one would have to peer into the world of  our grandchildren, the world of the twenty-first century``  .  We are now 15 years into the 21st  century, more than 35 years since the Charney report.  Our uncertainty of climate sensitivity  remains the same, despite 35 years of advances in modern observations, paleo observations, and  Earth system models.  We have, however, developed a much more rigorous understanding of the  sources and magnitude of uncertainty in climate sensitivity.    The 2010 U.S. Social Cost of Carbon Memo is the U.S. interagency guideline for understanding  potential future climate change impacts.  The document concludes that the largest uncertainty in  future impacts is caused by uncertainty in climate sensitivity.  The amount that the globe warms  is the pacemaker for almost all other climate change, whether sea level rise, drought, floods,  agriculture, health, or species loss.  The report also concludes that there is a roughly quadratic  relationship between amount of warming and amount of economic impact.  This nonlinearity is  caused by the fact that current societal infrastructure is designed to handle climate natural  variability.  When climate change causes those historical limits to be exceeded, large and  nonlinear economic impacts ensue.  The quadratic relationship suggests that on the longest time  scales, uncertainty of a factor of 4 in climate sensitivity leads to a factor of 16 uncertainty in  economic impacts.  This is not true for the next few decades, but becomes increasingly true as  time scales increase to 50 or 100 or 200 years from now.  Much of the uncertainty about climate  change mitigation efforts is tied to uncertainty about future economic impacts.    Why has it been so difficult to narrow the uncertainty in climate sensitivity?  Five IPCC reports  have extensively examined this challenge using modern observations, paleo observations, and  the range of results using climate and Earth System models including Perturbed Physics  Ensembles.   All three approaches suggest a similar uncertainty in climate sensitivity.  The  dominant cause of this uncertainty continues to be cloud feedback, in particular low cloud      2  feedback (IPCC, 2013).  One of the major reasons is that explicit modeling of low clouds using  Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models typically requires grid box scales of ~ 10 meters,  compared to a highest resolution of  ~100 km in global climate models.        Solution of this challenge requires advances in both modeling and observing capabilities.  For  observations related to the Decadal Survey, there is a need for advances in both cloud process  observations as well as long term decadal change observations.  Neither short term cloud process  observations alone, nor long term climate change observations alone can solve this challenge.   Nor can observations alone or models alone solve this challenge.  NASA can clearly provide  unique contributions in the area of improved process observations from space (e.g. A-train) and  long-term climate change observations from space (e.g. CERES, MODIS, CALIPSO, CloudSat,  GPM).  A key question to consider is the relative contributions and requirements for improved  long term climate records of clouds, aerosols, and radiation versus improved process  observations of the same.  Neither alone will be sufficient.  We note also that solution of the  cloud feedback and climate sensitivity challenge is also related to solution of the anthropogenic  aerosol indirect effect uncertainty.  Observed decadal changes in clouds must be separated  between anthropogenic aerosol induced change and anthropogenic greenhouse warming induced  change.    2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?    Given the inability to narrow uncertainty in cloud feedback during the last 35 years, one might  be tempted to conclude that either a) the problem is too hard or b) it will take too long to solve.   A pair of recent studies (Cooke et al. 2014, 2015) examined the world economic value of moving  forward by ~ 15 years the ability to narrow uncertainty in climate sensitivity.  The result of both  studies suggested a value of ~ $10 Trillion U.S. dollars to society if this could be accomplished.   Sensitivity studies showed that the economic value of doing so depended little on when it was  done: only on the fact that you could advance progress by 15 years.  This seems puzzling until  you realize that this is in fact a `delta` calculation: we are not estimating total climate change  impacts, only the value of moving forward knowledge by N years to enable better societal  decisions to deal with these impacts.  This suggests that the `value` of reducing uncertainty in  climate sensitivity 15 years sooner than `science as usual` is roughly $10 Trillion dollars.   NASA's entire earth science budget is ~ $1.7B per year: 6000 times smaller than the potential  gain for society.  The investment leveraging potential of reducing uncertainty in climate  sensitivity sooner rather than later is immense, and the Decadal Survey should seriously consider  how to accomplish this goal.    Since the last decadal survey, there are several technological advances that have matured into  readiness to improve our attack on this challenge.  The First advance, is that computational  capability now allows the potential to run LES cloud models at 1000 km scale for short  simulations (days).  This allows for the first time a true overlap of climate models and cloud  models all the way to LES scales.  Global 3-D 1 km cloud resolving models have also been run  for periods of up to a year.  Multi-scale Modeling Framework (MMF) climate models have  developed ways to merge 2-D cloud resolving models within 3-D climate models.  Further      3  advances in the next decade mean that testing cloud modeling in climate models is at the cusp of  major potential advances in cloud modeling.  Will the observations be there to test them?    The Second advance is that the 2007 Decadal Survey CLARREO mission has spent the last 7  years working on demonstration instruments with NIST calibration verification to allow  improvements in calibration for both narrowband and broadband spaceborne sensors by a factor  of 5 across the entire thermal infrared spectrum and a factor of 10 across the entire reflected solar  spectrum  (Wielicki et al, 2013).  These advances are critical if we are to verify cloud and  radiation decadal changes to the accuracy needed to detect cloud feedback (Wielicki et al., 2013)  sooner than our current observations can provide.  Figure 1 below shows the relationship  between accuracy and time to detect decadal change of shortwave cloud radiative effect, the  dominant signal for low cloud feedback (Soden et al. 2008, Wielicki et al. 2013).  Using  CLARREO to calibrate CERES can accelerate results by 20 to 30 years depending on the  uncertainty desired.   Figure 1.  Trend uncertainty in shortwave cloud radiative forcing (CRF) per decade (the dominant signal  of low cloud feedback) versus instrument calibration accuracy.    The recently released NRC report `Continuity of NASA Earth Observations from Space: A  Value Framework` (2015) shows an example in Appendix C of how narrowing uncertainty in  climate sensitivity can be understood as a Quantitative Earth Science Objective and demonstrates   0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  0  10  20  30  40  50  Tr en  d  Ac  cu ra  cy  (%  CR F/  de ca  de , 9  5%  C  on fid  en ce  )  Length of Observed Trend (Years)  0 %  0.15%  0.3%  0.6% 1.2% 1.8% 2.4% 3.0% 3.6%  b!

Lack of such accuracy in the last 35 years of cloud feedback observations is a major  reason for lack of progress to date.  Serious consideration should also be given to the need for  long term climate change observations of space based lidar (e.g CALIPSO) and radar (e.g.  CloudSat) for cloud properties (compared to cloud imagers such as MODIS or VIIRS).  Lidar in  particular provides the most rigorous observation of cloud fraction and cloud height: the two  cloud variables considered to be most critical for cloud feedbacks in the reflected solar and  infrared.  For annual mean zonal and global cloud observations, nadir lidar provides sufficient  sampling to reduce sampling uncertainty to levels below that of natural variability.  These active  sensors should be evaluated for continuity requirements using the new NRC Continuity  Framework.          The Third advance is that efforts to demonstrate new lidar (high spectral resolution), radar  (multi-wavelength), and radiometer (multi-angle polarimeter) technologies have demonstrated  new tools to improve aerosol and cloud process observations from space (e.g. ACE from the  2007 Decadal Survey).      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?    Because clouds and radiation are highly variable in space and time, only space based global  observations can provide constraints on global cloud feedback.  The decadal signals of clouds  and aerosols that drive global change are subtle and require both rigorous calibration over time  as well as sufficiently complete sampling to observe.  Surface and in-situ observations are  critical for process studies, but cannot provide global change constraints and verification that  climate models can produce the correct cloud feedback for the correct cloud types.

This white paper discusses the status of operational satellite measurements that are primarily used for   space weather applications but also contribute to earth science research. A key benefit of operational   satellite data is the long-term consistency in the measurements over multiple decades thereby allowing   one to better examine temporal changes in the earth-sun system. This white paper provides a broad   view of how space weather data contribute to several active research areas in earth science. A   background section provides an overview of the operational satellites with space weather sensors,   mostly operated by the U.S. The remainder of this whitepaper describes relevant technology areas   within which responses to the posed questions are provided within the context of available space   weather data. Reference is made, as appropriate, to more detailed white papers that are submitted   separately.   Background – Since the early 1970’s, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of   Defense (DoD) have continuously operated environmental satellite systems with sensors for monitoring   the near-earth space environment and sun. The Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites   (POES) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft are located in polar sun-  synchronous low-earth orbit (LEO) at altitudes of about 840 km. At this altitude these satellites are   within the topside ionosphere and outer thermosphere. Farther out the Geostationary Operational   Environmental Satellites (GOES) are located at about 6.7 earth radii and near the dayside separation   between the earth’s magnetosphere and interplanetary space. While the primary missions for these   spacecraft are weather monitoring, each system includes a complement of space environment sensors   that serve the real-time needs of operational space weather forecasters. Historical space weather data   are made freely available to the research and applications communities through a number of data   portals.   The POES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) measures the characteristics of the in-situ charged particle   environment, electrons and protons, over a broad energy range from auroral energies (~160 eV) to   several MeV. SEM packages (provided by the DOC) are similarly included on the European MetOp   satellites, also in polar LEO orbits. Processed SEM data (1978-to-present) are available from the National   Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) (see Links to Data). Each DMSP satellite includes a   complement of space weather sensors to measures the local thermal and energetic charged particle     Under Development: 02 Nov 2015 (Final Draft)   environment and magnetic field as well as ultraviolet imagery of the upper atmosphere and thermal ion   densities and drifts. DMSP space weather data from 1982 to present are available from NCEI as well as   from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) and the Naval Research   Laboratory (NRL). Unfortunately, there is considerable uncertain in the continuity of space weather data   from LEO with DMSP and POES each reaching their respective end of life (EOL) in the near future. Only   MetOp, with a projected EOL in 2023, will provide LEO space weather measurements into the mid-term.   At the present time, there is no clear strategy for follow-on LEO satellites providing operational space   weather data near the end of the decadal period.   The future of space weather data from the GOES at Geostationary earth orbit is considerably brighter.   The GOES-R series of satellites should be operational throughout the decadal period. The space weather   sensors on GOES provide a comprehensive set of measurements of the in-situ particle and magnetic   field environments plus observations of the sun consisting of imagery and irradiance. Data from 1974 to   present are available from NCEI and we expect continuity of these data throughout the life of GOES-R   through 2036. “Space weather” data from GOES that are most applicable to earth science research   include the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar-irradiance observations and measurements of energetic solar   protons. It is likely that during the decadal period other nations will field space weather sensors on their   respective geostationary satellites which would provide additional data useful to the earth sciences.   The following earth science technology areas benefit from the availability of space weather sensors on   operational environmental satellites. The text below just general summarizes each area and more   detailed white papers may be submitted separately.   1. High Energy Particle Participation in the Atmosphere (HEPPA)   The HEPPA topical area is focused on the observational and modeling studies of atmospheric and   ionospheric changes caused by energetic particle precipitation (EPP); e.g., solar proton events, medium   and relativistic electron precipitation, and comparatively low-energy auroral electron precipitation. EPP   affects atmospheric composition, mainly by formation of reactive nitrogen and hydrogen species, which   interact with ozone. The science question addressed by this work is the EPP Indirect Effect (IE), whereby   NOx produced in the mesosphere or thermosphere via EPP (EPP-NOx) descends to the stratosphere   during the polar winter, where it can participate in catalytic ozone destruction [Randall et al., 2007].   There are also questions around the direct effect caused by the immediate ozone loss from HOx   [Andersson et al.; 2014] and the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects. The resultant   application is in evaluating and constraining global models to investigate coupling of the upper and   lower atmosphere by the EPP direct and IE, including any influences this might have on ozone trends   and possibly on climate. POES/MetOp SEM measurements are fundamental to monitoring EPP and the   likely loss of these data during the decadal period will be detrimental to the HEPPA technology area.   2. Integrated Dynamics in Earth’s Atmosphere (IDEA)   NOAA has an operational need to implement IDEA as an extension to the current National Weather   Service’s operational Global Forecast System (GFS) model to improve our understanding of the   connection between the terrestrial and space weather mainly driven by the solar-wind-magnetosphere     Under Development: 02 Nov 2015 (Final Draft)   interaction [Akmaev et al., 2008; Fuller-Rowell et al., 2008]. The strategy involves coupling the extended   GFS called Whole Atmospheric Model (WAM) with the Global Ionosphere-Plasmasphere   Electrodynamics (IPE) Model [Sun et al., 2015], due to the crucial mutual interaction between neutral   and ionized species in the upper atmosphere. The overarching goal for the IDEA project is to advance   our space weather forecasting capability which, in turn, would contribute to improved navigation and   communications and to determinations of satellite drag. Both DMSO and POES measurements have   provided significant contributions to developing and improving the IDEA model. Measurements of the   atomic oxygen airglow by space-based ultraviolet imagery on DMSP can contribute to an improved   gravity wave parameterization in IDEA. While the EOL for DMSP is nominally planned for 2022 recent   Congressional action may prematurely terminate in program prior in the near future.   3. World Magnetic Model (WMM)   The SWARM research satellite is currently providing exquisite measurements of the earth’s magnetic   field, which are used to improve the accuracy and resolution of world magnetic models and to address   DoD requirements for the WMM. While the operational DMSP spacecraft provides a supporting   measurement of the geomagnetic field, the accuracy of the DMSP data is not sufficient to satisfy the   needs of the magnetic modeling.  Science questions to address from continued measurements ranging   from quantifying the impact of ocean circulation on the measured secular field [Manoj et al., 2006] to   verifying the physical source of recently observed geomagnetic jerks and pulses on the main field   [Chulliat et al., 2015]. We expect that SWARM will reach its effective EOL in about 2021. Also, as noted   above, the questionable longevity of DMSP, makes it all the more critical that a follow-on magnetic field   mission be planned. A separate whitepaper has been submitted to the panel address that issues related   to the World Magnetic Model.   4. Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)   Total solar irradiance (TSI) is a primary factor in the energy balance of the earth system. Precise   measurements of TSI from satellites have been made since 1979 and are used to adjust the so-called   “solar constant” from its nominal value of 1.361 kilowatts per square meter. TSI also varies on   timescales ranging from decades to days due to fundamental changes in the solar features; for   examples, sunspots and sunspot groups, traversing the solar disk.  Variations in TSI are used as key   inputs to climate models to discriminate solar drivers from other factors, including anthropogenic   effects. TSI and the related Solar Spectral Irradiance are considered operational Climate Data Records   [Robinson et al; 2004] and the continuity of these records is of key importance to the climate   community.  The unfortunate launch failure of the GLORY spacecraft, as a continuity follow-on to the   NASA Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite has been somewhat mitigated by the TSI   Calibration Transfer Experiment (TCTE), launched in late 2013, and the planned deployment of the Total   and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2017 [Woods et al,   2014]. In 2015 the operational TSI monitoring mission within the U.S. was transferred from NOAA to   NASA for TSIS-1. Details for the TSIS-1 follow-on after 2022, within the decadal period, have not yet   been determined and should be a consideration for the panel.  A specific whitepaper on TSI and a     Under Development: 02 Nov 2015 (Final Draft)   general whitepaper on operational CDRs, recently renamed Reference Environmental Data Records, are   being submitted separately.   5. Solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Irradiance   Solar emissions at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths are absorbed in the earth's upper atmosphere,   heating the thermosphere and creating the ionosphere. While the TSI variability is 0.1%, the EUV   variability is >100%. These variations in the EUV flux drive the dynamics of the thermosphere and   ionosphere, and so EUV spectra are essential inputs for thermospheric / ionospheric models which are   used in satellite drag and communications models (e.g. WAM and IPE, as previously discussed). During   the decadal period the GOES-R Extreme Ultraviolet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensor (EXIS) will be an   operational monitor of the solar EUV irradiance. An international effort is continuing to ensure the   accuracy of the EUV record and the GOES-R EXIS will contribute to the development of a calibration   baseline for the community. Solar EUV irradiance measurements will also contribute to the HEPPA   technology area previously discussed.   References   Akmaev, R. A., T. J. Fuller-Rowell, F. Wu, J. M. Forbes, X. Zhang, A. F.

Clark (Planetary Science Institute)  Title:   Local to Global Remote Sensing of Surface and Atmospheric Chemistry  White Paper Description (350 character limit) *     A more complete understanding of our environment on planet Earth requires  understanding of the chemistry of the Earth system, including solid surface, liquid,  the cryosphere and the atmosphere.   Remote chemical mapping of the surface and  atmosphere can only be done with imaging spectrometers.   What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across  the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or  operations in the coming decade?      With the large human population on the Earth, we face new challenges to the  environment at all scales from local to global, surface to atmosphere.  The  environmental impacts result from many sources, including industrial applications,  expanding populations, to war.  Impacts can be local, including small scale  environmental disasters (e.g. the World Trade Center disaster), regional (the 2010  Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil spill, deforestation in the Amazon and other  regions around the world, including the current wars in the middle east, all of which  can have global impacts on the Earth system.  With the warming planet, the  chemical changes of the Earth's system, from changing surfaces (including  changing albedo from deforestation, farming, pollution, etc.) to changing  atmospheric chemistry (pollution, CO2, water vapor, other trace gases) affect the  radiative heat balance of the system.      The only way to measure chemistry on local to global scales is by spectroscopic  remote sensing.  To date, global remote sensing has been limited to broad-band and multispectral systems.  Such systems can show something is changing, but why?   Only by understanding the chemistry of the system can we really understand the  why.  The real problems in identifying chemistry with remote sensing is that there is  no “one band, one chemical/property.”  Every material absorbs and scatters at  multiple wavelengths, and only spectroscopy with sufficient spectral resolution and  spectral range can untangle the overlapping signatures from multiple materials (e.g. Clark 1999, Clark et al., 2003, Swayze et al., 2003).  The albedo of the Earth's  surface changes with sun altitude and atmospheric conditions, so only with full  spectral range measurements can we understand the complete radiative balance of  the Earth as a system and its changing nature, from diurnal to seasonal to decadal  and beyond.     Planetary scientists are sending imaging spectrometers on virtually every  mission, with amazing discoveries made all over the Solar System.  For example,  the detection of widespread water on the surface of the Moon was only possible  with an imaging spectrometer.  The detection went against prevailing theories that  the Moon was dry.  The discoveries made throughout the Solar System with  spectroscopy have been filled with surprises and the corresponding new chemical  insights fills many books.  Our understanding of the radiative heat balance in the  atmosphere is based on the spectroscopic absorptions and scattering in the  atmosphere, yet we have no such instrumentation in Earth orbit to measure the  chemistry of the Earth's surface on regional to global scales.  The use of     multispectral sensing is simply inadequate to understand the myriad of  environmental problems now facing the Earth system.  Multispectral sensing has too many false positives and negatives due to inadequate sensing of the complex  absorptions and scattering in the spectral response of the Earth's many surface  materials (e.g. Clark et al., 2003).     For example, consider the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The spill was  regional, making it difficult to cover by aircraft.  A satellite with a wide swath was  needed. Further, a system with the spectral resolution to resolve the absorptions in  the oil and distinguishing them from those in liquid water and water vapor was  critical to assess the amount of oil on the ocean's surface (Clark et al., 2010).  No  such satellite existed and AVIRIS was flown periodically for over 4 months to get a  statistical sampling.  A wide swath satellite imaging spectrometer with repeat  coverage of a few days was needed.  And this is just one of multiple environmental  disasters around the world each year.     Understanding climate change requires a better understanding of the spectral  response of the Earth's changing surface, including sources of dust, air pollution,  natural and man-made sources of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere.  The spectral albedo of the polar regions is critical to  understanding the radiative heat balance.  Changes in snow and ice grain size can  have a large change in IR albedo that is not obvious at visible wavelengths and  grain size effects can have a larger effect than small amounts of carbon soot in the  snow pack on the radiative heat balance (Tedesco et al., 2015).  The full solar  reflected light range (0.3 to 3 microns) is needed with spectral resolution to resolve  ice features sufficient to characterize grain size and carbon contamination is needed to fully understand the the changing polar regions.     The list of Earth system challenges goes on and are too numerous to list.  It is  clear that the myriad of problems on such large scales can only be characterized  well with imaging spectrometers with sufficient spectral range, surface spatial  resolution, and repeat coverage.  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with  respect to readiness?       While we needed high spectral and spatial resolution imaging spectrometers in  orbit decades ago, the large data volume, computer power, storage to manage the  data and the immaturity of analysis algorithms made such satellite instruments  difficult on all levels, from instrumentation, detectors, data flow to the ground, and  generation of useful data products.  But with the advancement on all these fronts,  such imaging systems are now practical, though still a challenge that will push  limits. Foremost in technology now is the advancement in sensors and computer  technology.  The advancement in computer technology has also enabled maturity of imaging spectroscopy analysis algorithms (e.g. Clark et al, 2003, 2010, 2014;  Schaepman et al., 2009 and references therein).  It is now feasible to analyze  imaging spectrometer data in near real time, producing maps of thousands of  compounds.   Such a data set would show new insights into the changing chemistry  of the Earth's surface and atmosphere as a function of time on local to global scales.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?      Only space satellite based systems can provide global coverage on short time  scales (days to weeks) and with wide swath widths (hundreds of km) for rapid  assessments of large regional events.     In order to balance data volume with technology to acquire, transmit and process the massive data volumes from imaging spectrometers and with enough spectral  and spatial resolution to untangle complex chemistry in the Earth system, the  following strategy makes it feasible to make major advances in Earth system  science.  A four component strategy:    1) High spatial resolution multispectral imager covering the reflected solar spectral  range (0.3 to 3 microns) with at least 15 meters/pixel in several bands (not less than 5 bands) plus several bands in the thermal range (8 to 16 microns) with at least 60- meters/pixel spatial resolution.  Global coverage at least every week  2) Moderate spatial resolution, wide swath imaging spectrometer (0.3 to 3 microns), at least 5 nm sampling with 5 to 7 nm bandpass, 60 meters/pixel or better.  Global  coverage every week.  3) High spatial resolution imaging spectrometer (0.3 to 3 microns) at least 5 nm  sampling with 5 to 7 nm bandpass, 20 meters/pixel.  Swath width of tens of  kilometers.  Steerable to point at local areas and make emisssion-phase function  measurements.  4) High spectral resolution profiling (or spatial jail bar) spectrometer.  Footprint  matches #2, spectral range 0.3 to 20 microns, spectral resolving power > 3000 in the reflected solar range, and at least 4 wavenumber in the thermal.   Minimum one along track profile centered on #1 and #2, ideally multiple profiles across track (jail  bars).    The high resolution profiling spectrometer enables details of atmospheric and  surface chemistry to be determined on a fine scale, and enables extension of the  moderate resolution imaging spectrometer to resolve issues with unresolved  spectral components, thus extending chemical mapping with higher precision.  The  high resolution multispectral images extends moderate resolution imaging  spectrometer compositional maps to higher spatial resolutions.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? A fundamental question for Earth System Science is: How is the climate of the Earth changing on decadal time scales?  Quantitative, global answers to this question will form an important part of the foundation needed for very difficult governmental policy decisions expected to require significant societal changes to avoid dire consequences for future generations.  The radiation imbalance of the earth-atmosphere system is a fundamental signal of climate change and requires measurements that are global, long-lasting and highly accurate. Only with such measurements can we tease out long-term climate change trends and determine the accuracy of climate change projections. The recommendation in this white paper is for a space-based approach to more direct measurements of the radiation imbalance that is a key indicator in changes in the global climate.  The major point in this white paper is that there is a critical need for radiation imbalance measurements and that and improved measurement approach independent of past space-based retrievals is necessary to achieve the accuracy required to make informed policy decisions.  One possible sampling scheme for radiation imbalance retrievals is through a constellation approach with a fleet of wide-angle viewing, broadband sensors in various orbital inclinations and altitudes to achieve the angular, temporal, and spatial range of sampling needed to measure the imbalance more directly than done with sun-synchronous or mid-inclination only systems.  Note, that it is not the goal of this white paper to propose a specific satellite mission, but to advocate for a different method to measure radiation imbalance.  The constellation approach is one way to do this and serves as an illustration. a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?  The existing national and international compliment of Earth observing systems includes radiation budget measurements that make use of mid-inclination and sun-synchronous low-earth orbits.  The radiation budget is inferred from global measurements of upwelling total, shortwave, and longwave broadband radiances supplemented by ancillary data from ground-based and model-based sources, and implementing conversion factors to transform radiances to fluxes.  The existing systems lack the proven absolute accuracy necessary to evaluate the radiation budget imbalance or even track its relative temporal variability. NASA’s planned CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) attempts to address both the sampling and accuracy issue while also providing a spectral knowledge that will be important for understanding the earth climate system.  Including broadband measurements of upwelling radiation from a constellation of sensors designed to sample spatially and temporally in a much different fashion than CLARREO would provide supplementary information that ensures the sampling fidelity of CLARREO. b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs The current lack of globally-based, wide-angle radiation measurements from space has led to a range of innovative approaches to determine radiation imbalance.  The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) processing approach is one example.  Another has been the use of an international array of Argo floats, measuring ocean heat content to a depth of 2000 m.  By 2006 there were about 3000 floats covering most of the world ocean. These floats allowed estimates during the 6-year period of 2005-2010 that the upper 2 km of the world ocean gained energy at a rate 0.41 W/m2 averaged over the planet. Incorporating a global set of wide-angle measurements from space has the potential to provide direct radiation imbalance estimates, and will enhance the science value of already-existing data sets.  An improved set of sensors with known SI-traceability and suitable stability and precision will allow key climate questions to be answered. c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits Observed planetary energy gain during the recent strong solar minimum reveals that solar forcing of climate, though significant, is being overwhelmed by a much larger net human-made climate forcing. The indirectly inferred radiation imbalance confirms that, if other climate forcings are fixed, atmospheric CO2 must be reduced to about 350 ppm or less to stop global warming.  When many climate models contributing to the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change employed aerosol forcings in the range -0.5 to -1.1 Wm-2, they achieved good agreement with observed global warming over the past century, suggesting that the aerosol forcing is only moderate. However, an ambiguity remains among the climate models. Most of the models used in IPCC  mix heat efficiently into the intermediate and deep ocean, requiring thus a large climate forcing (~2 Wm-2) to warm Earth's surface by the observed 0.8°C over the past century. Was the ocean mixing heat into the deeper ocean less efficiently, the net climate forcing needed to match observed global warming would have been smaller.   An accurately-measured Earth radiation imbalance provides a way to resolve this ambiguity. The case of rapid ocean mixing and small aerosol forcing requires a large planetary radiation imbalance to yield the observed surface warming.  Quantifying the imbalance at a level that permits attribution of the dominant causes of warming provides exactly the information policy makers need to determine whether society attempts to mitigate warming or rather concentrates on understanding the impacts that warming will have. d. The science communities that would be involved.  The CLARREO Science Definition Team and CERES science users would be the starting point for understanding the spaceborne capabilities described in this white paper.  These two teams include both the government and academic sectors.  It is essential to include also the Argo buoy teams for their expertise in assessing radiation imbalance.  Ensuring the climate modeling community is also engaged is important to refine the information that is needed to address the radiation imbalance question rather than recommending a specific measurement and sensor approach. 2. Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Beyond the fact that climate change is one of the dominant issues affecting mankind in the next several decades, the confluence of several key factors in recent years to points towards the need to refine our methods for measuring the earth radiation imbalance.  First, certain successes of past radiation budget measurements provide guidance on where we can improve our measurement approaches.  The CLARREO mission is a direct result of that.  Second, the importance of making highly accurate and SI-traceable measurements is now recognized and, more importantly, the techniques for doing so are becoming better understood.  Third, the design of on-orbit sensors has improved to a technical readiness level where implementing high-accuracy on orbit can be proven to be achievable.  Four, the success of the A-train and other constellation approaches combined with an improved ability to makes smaller sensor packages gives confidence that a fleet of radiation imbalance sensors can be readily developed and deployed.  Finally, sensor harmonization methods have been developed in the past decade making it feasible to put a fleet of sensors onto a single radiometric scale allowing the data from a fleet of sensors to be used for radiation imbalance retrievals. 3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  As stated above, attempts to determine the radiation imbalance from non-space-based data have been underway for a while, but those approaches are not fully global in there sampling.  By nature, the radiation imbalance is a global quantity that relates to shortwave and longwave radiation directed from Earth to space. Any assets measuring radiative flux deployed at other vantage points such as ground or somewhere within the atmosphere, would not only suffer huge coverage gaps, but would also measure radiative quantities that would be hard to relate to the radiation imbalance.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic   research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Surface current is a critical ocean variable that is not measured by today’s global observing   system.  Although geostrophic currents may be deduced from satellite altimetry data, these currents are  generally not representative of surface currents, which have strong ageostrophic contributions.  Because  of the substantial, but yet poorly understood, vertical shear near the ocean’s surface (Figure 1), ocean  models still struggle to accurately simulate and predict the surface currents.    Yet it is the surface  current that most directly affects human activities and the results of those activities.  A key challenge  for Earth System Science in the coming decade is to be able to observe and predict the surface currents  over the global ocean.                  2.  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?  Lessons from recent disasters including major oil spills and debris releases from tsunamis have   taught us that our present understanding and depiction of surface currents that move this material is  sorely lacking.  Though technology to remotely sense surface currents is well established using ground‐ based sensors, these data are only available for instrumented locations of the coastal ocean in  developed nations.  Advances in acquiring and processing microwave backscatter data (e.g., Doppler  scatterometry) now allow for the possibility of observing the global ocean’s surface currents from space‐ based platforms, providing not only a valuable new data source of a previously unobserved variable for  scientific discovery and contribution to the climate data record, but important observations that have  profound practical applications ranging from human safety to mitigation of environmental disasters.   International interest (specifically from Indian and Japanese space agencies) in collaborating on  instrument design and activities related to the mission make this a very tractable effort in terms of  technology and cost in the coming decade.   Figure 1.  Map of mean shear  between the surface and 15m depth  inferred from satellite‐tracked drifting  buoys in the ocean, considering buoys  with drogues at 15m and those that  have lost drogues.     Typically a difficult variable to measure, surface currents are related to the underlying ocean  velocity and overlying atmospheric forcing through complex ocean mixed layer dynamics. Satellite  observations of surface currents with uniform coverage and quality will help to elucidate the rectified  effects of surface waves (including Stokes drift by linear waves, momentum injection by breaking waves,  and wave‐induced turbulence), the diurnal cycle and many other high‐frequency processes not resolved  by the observing system, improving their theoretical description and numerical modeling capability.   Combined with the existing and advanced satellite observations of surface winds, surface current  observations will improve understanding of the atmosphere‐ocean interaction through fluxes of  momentum and energy. This interaction is of critical importance for the Earth Climate System.   A non‐exhaustive list of applications to society of satellite‐based observations of surface  currents includes:    Tracking of Contaminants and Debris   During the 2010 DeepWater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, substantial uncertainty  existed in predictions of the movement of the surface oil (Figure 2), despite the availability of  extensive observing systems and operational and experimental ocean and weather models (Liu et  al., 2011).  The 2011 tsunami that devastated parts of the Japanese coast released a very large  amount of debris into the Pacific Ocean.  Floating objects within this debris field are expected to  impact coastal areas throughout North America in the coming years (Maximenko et al., 2015).       Figure 2.  Temporal coverage of surface oil (fraction of total time period 22 April 2010 – 14 July 2010  that oil was present in each 5km x 5km grid cell) from two simulations of the BP Deepwater Horizon  oil spill using different methods of computing surface drift from ocean model currents.     Nearly no data on surface currents are available from observing networks (e.g., coastal radar) in  coastal areas of less developed nations or over the open ocean that can be used for tracking oil or  floating debris, and global ocean models suffer from uncertainties in wind forcing over poorly  observed regions. Since floating material moves with the current at the very surface of the ocean  and numerical models instead simulate the current averaged over a layer typically several meters  deep, rather crude methods are typically used to parameterize the surface currents from models     accounting for vertical shear dependent on wind.  Thus, uncertainties in the wind‐driven model  currents as well as in methods of inferring surface currents from model currents proves to be the  most challenging factors in predicting surface drift.  Tracking of floating contaminants and debris  would benefit greatly from near‐real‐time observations of global ocean surface currents.    Biological Applications  At a recent NOAA/NASA funded workshop on fisheries and climate (St. Petersburg, October   2015), enhanced observations of physical oceanographic variables including surface currents were  identified as a high‐priority need, which was particularly interesting considering the overwhelming  majority of participants were from the biology disciplines.  However, the larvae of many aquatic  species are buoyant and future advances in management will consider larvae transport in  determining recruitment for stock assessment.  A recent episode of anomalously thick Sargassum (a  floating aquatic plant) in the Caribbean has had profound impacts on the marine ecosystem, and the  source of this Sargassum is not known (Johnson et al., 2012).  These are just examples of biological  material transported by surface currents, satellite observations of which would have important  applications in marine ecosystem research and management.    Forecasting and Operational Applications  Maritime safety, transportation, and military operations depend critically on analyses and forecasts  of surface currents.  These activities are supported by private and governmental operational centers  that analyze available observations and use ocean model forecasts to provide data on surface  currents directly to users in the field for activities including: search‐and‐rescue,  naval operations  and ship routing.  The availability of near‐real‐time observations of global surface currents would  have a profound impact on these activities, reducing shipping time and fuel usage, reducing loss of  life at sea, and enhancing warfighting capabilities.   3.  Why are space‐based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?  Presently, the ability to respond to disasters and provide data on surface currents for   applications such as those listed above depends fundamentally on geographic location.  The availability  of coastal and marine‐based observations and veracity of models for providing surface current data  varies widely throughout the world.  A large majority of applications of surface currents  Space‐based  observations of the ocean surface currents will not only provide direct observations of a key variable of  high relevance to society, but can also readily be used in conjunction with other space‐based  observations (for example, altimetry and winds) and in situ observations (upper ocean velocity from  surface drifters and current meter moorings) to address the outstanding scientific questions in the  oceanographic and atmospheric science communities regarding the vertical structure of the near‐ surface ocean currents, air‐sea fluxes of momentum and kinetic energy, and turbulence in the upper  ocean, as a lack of understanding of the vertical structure of the near‐surface velocity field is a major  source of uncertainty in the ability to predict the movement of oil, debris, people, and biological  material.  A combination of currents and ocean color will be highly useful for coupling physical and  biological ocean modeling.         References

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the  coming Decade?     Key Challenge/Question: What are the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of  permafrost soils and what are their feedbacks to/from the regional and global climate?    High latitude ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to the effects of global warming.  Permafrost systems, in particular, may be at risk of reduction or loss. Permafrost is soil  that is frozen (temperature of 0oC or lower) continuously for at least two years.  Permafrost is most continuous in the coldest climates such as the North Slope of Alaska,  becoming more fragmented in warmer climate zones.  The thickness of permafrost  changes accordingly, from about 600 m in the north to about 40 m in the Alaskan interior  (NRC, 1995). Permafrost is nearly water-impermeable, resulting in non-or slowly  draining water within seasonally thawed surface soil layers (Dingman, 1975; Hobbie,  1984). The maximum thickness of the soil that thaws in the summer is called the active  layer.     The active layer thickness (ALT) may be increasing in strong correlation with climate  warming trends occurring rapidly over northern (≥45°N) latitudes at approximately twice  the rate of other global areas.  Currently, there are insufficient observations to ascertain  the pattern or rates of ALT deepening and permafrost decline at regional or continental  scales. There are several adverse effects of permafrost degradation and ALT deepening:   • Loss or reduction of permafrost can have detrimental impacts on urban, rural,  transportation,and resource exploration infrastructure in northern communities  due to diminished ground stability.    • Permafrost soils contain roughly half of the global reservoir of soil organic  carbon, possibly destabilizing as permafrost thaws, thereby increasing  atmospheric carbon emissions and intensifying global warming (e.g. Schuur et al.  2015).      • Permafrost degradation and ALT deepening has been shown to impact the  dynamics of overlying vegetation in northern regions, altering vegetation structure  and productivity, species composition and wildfire (NRC, 1995; Vitt et al., 2000;  Camill et al., 2001; Jorgenson et al., 2001; Turetsky et al., 2002b; Christensen et  al., 2004; Osterkamp et al., 2000; Jorgenson and Osterkamp, 2005).   • Wetland extent and permafrost are closely linked in the high latitudes (National  Research Council (NRC), 1995; Dingman and Koutz, 1974; Van Cleve and  Viereck, 1983; Van Cleve et al., 1991; Myers-Smith et al., 2007), and permafrost  degradation may result in wetland loss. Conversely, permafrost melting can create  additional small water bodies or wetlands that often become anaerobic fostering  methanogenic bacteria. These effects can impact flora, fauna, and trace gas  balance in the Arctic (CO2 and CH4).     In Alaska, active layer thickness can range from 20 cm to > 2 m (NRC, 1995). Time- series measurements of permafrost soil temperatures at numerous boreholes in Alaska  and other northern pan-Arctic land areas have shown significant warming trends within  these systems (Romanovsky et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010). Although this evidence is  strong, data are only available at a number of point locations. The large-scale  distributions and dynamics are not well known.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?     Observations and information on permafrost and active layer dynamics will provide a  unique opportunity to assess the climate feedbacks in permafrost systems and are needed  to (1) assess their impact on northern communities and infrastructure and (2) inform a  succession of land surface hydrology and terrestrial carbon and climate model  projections. Even though many groups have investigated and collected data on the spatial  distribution and depth of permafrost in Alaska and other northern land areas, these  measurements have been of very limited spatial extent; no consistent information is  available on the depth of the active layer at larger and continuous regional scales, inter- seasonally or inter-annually. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted extensive  borehole temperature measurements acquired in permafrost regions of arctic Alaska  between 1950 and 1988 at 87 locations (http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/bht/alaska/). Other  data sets include 41 University of Alaska borehole measurements, primarily along the  trans-Alaska pipeline route (Osterkamp, 1986; Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999;  Osterkamp, 2008; Romanovsky et al., 2012). The data indicate widespread surface and  soil warming trends, ALT deepening and warming of upper permafrost layers. The rate of  such possible loss may, at best, be known at the locations of these boreholes, but not on a  large spatial scale    There are a number of other ground-based data sets: Nelson (1997, 1998) collected thaw  depth and air temperature measurements on the North Slope from 1995-1997 and  compared the measurements to analytic model results. Ground penetrating radar (GPR)  and LiDAR terrain mapping with ground based GPR and electrical resistivity  measurements provide for detailed assessment and process understanding of active layer     and permafrost properties but are unsuitable for more extensive regional mapping and  monitoring.  Others have used combinations of ground-based and (optical) satellite data  to produce empirical, semi-empirical, statistical, or process-based maps of permafrost  (Jorgenson et al. (2008), Anisimov et al. (2002), Romanovsky and Osterkamp (1997),  Zhang et al. (1999), Pastick et al. (2014)). These methods provide for detailed estimation  of permafrost properties such as active layer and near surface permafrost conditions, but  their accuracy is limited by the duration and range of conditions represented by sparse  ground truth measurements used to train or validate the methods.     Satellite microwave remote sensing from long-wavelength active synthetic aperture radar  (SAR) sensors may offer a superior approach for direct assessments of active layer and  permafrost properties, and regional monitoring of spatial and temporal changes at the  scale of landscape heterogeneity in these processes. Use of low-frequency SAR  observations may offer the only feasible method for such direct observations. The L-band  frequency has been used to estimate soil moisture in the top 0-5 centimeters in the  presence of up to 5 kg/m2 of vegetation water content (Dubois and van Zyl, 1995; Oh et  al. 1992; Entekhabi et al. 2014; others).  P-band and lower frequencies have been used to  retrieve soil moisture in the 0 cm to 50 cm depth or more, with as much as 15 kg/m2 of  vegetation water content  (Moghaddam et al., 2000; Moghaddam et al., 2007;  Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2015; others).     While P-band SAR data can retrieve soil moisture content and active layer depth with  good accuracy, they do so as long as the depth of the active layer is larger than  approximately 10-15 cm (i.e., essentially all permafrost areas of Alaska at peak thaw but  a smaller area in Spring and Fall), because the long P-band wavelengths cannot resolve  the smaller layer depths. But with simultaneous use of L-band and P-band observations,  retrieval in shallower depths becomes more accurate. On the other hand, soil moisture  retrieval accuracy is decreased for thicknesses of more than 50 cm, since L-band signals  lose their sensitivity to larger depth profiles and thus the deeper frozen layers are more  accurately resolved with the P-band data. Simultaneous SAR observations at P-Band and  L-Band, with algorithms that properly balance the contributions of the two frequencies,  are therefore required. There is substantial technology and algorithm heritage for long- wavelength radar sensors, resulting in an advanced readiness level for realizing dual- frequency observations.    The above analysis is consistent with the recommendations of a recent National  Academies report prioritizing the need for improved ALT observations from remote  sensing, including active layer soil moisture and thermal properties (NRC 2014).     3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     In response to question 2, above, examples of existing data sets over Alaska are the best  data available; even so, their spatial and temporal extents are limited and the various data  sets are not spatially and temporally consistent. In the larger circum-boreal and circum- arctic regions outside of Alaska, even fewer data sets are available, leaving an enormous     knowledge gap in the dynamics of permafrost soils and active layer, and therefore a  critical gap in our ability to understand and predict the social and climate feedbacks of  changes in permafrost systems. The boreal and arctic permafrost regions occupy roughly  a quarter of the northern hemisphere land surface, and notably, more than 80% of Alaska,  more than 50% of Canada, and more than 60% of Eurasia. Space-based remote sensing is  the only feasible way to make extensive and frequent observations of these rapidly  changing areas.    Satellite microwave remote sensing from long wavelength active radar sensors offer an  approach for direct assessment of active layer and permafrost properties, and regional  monitoring of spatial and temporal changes at the scale of landscape heterogeneity in  these processes, particularly when coupled with LiDAR measurements of surface  deformation resulting from ice melt and synergistic use of other efforts mapping surface  vegetation and topography as indirect metrics of permafrost extent.       a) Will existing and planned U.S. and international programs provide the  capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and  associated questions? If not, what additional investments are needed?     The measurements required to achieve the science objectives to characterize spatial and  temporal dynamics of permafrost active layer thickness are simultaneous, involving  multi-year P-band and L-band polarimetric SAR coupled with other mapping efforts  including optical and lidar data. No such capabilities exist from current or planned US or  international space-based programs, but a limited number of airborne data sets are  available.    Airborne: NASA is supporting the collection of a small number of joint P-band and L- band airborne SAR data in Alaska using the AirMOSS and UAVSAR systems through an  Indisciplinary Science (IDS) program. Preliminary retrieval results have shown good  promise for mapping the changes in the subsurface, including the depth and moisture  content of the active layer and the depth to water table. It may be possible to acquire a  more extensive dual-frequency airborne data set over Alaska and western Canada as part  of the airborne component of the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE;  Goetz et al., 2011). ABoVE also has substantial ground-based and modeling components,  which will be essential in validation of the airborne SAR mapping results, and helping  enhance and fine-tune the retrieval algorithms and experiment designs.    Spaceborne: An L-band spaceborne SAR mission is currently operated by JAXA  (ALOS/PALSAR-2); an L-band mission is planned for launch in 2020 by NASA/ISRO  (NI-SAR); ESA is also planning to launch a P-band SAR in 2020 (BIOMASS). However,  each of these satellites has orbits, look geometries, and revisit times that are quite  different from the others. Furthermore, it is not clear whether they will cover the northern  latitudes that are the specific targets of permafrost studies. Importantly, for ESA’s  BIOMASS, there is currently no transmit permission over US (including Alaska) or  Canada. For non-US satellites, data policies could also be impediments in accessing data     reliably. Therefore, for multiple reasons, the current and planned missions will not  provide the data needed for achieving the goal of consistent, sustained, and accurate  observations of permafrost soil dynamics. Any future investments must address the  development of simultaneous, or close-tandem, L- and P-band SAR satellites with  identical look geometries, with repeat observation cycles that capture the rapid onsets of  permafrost active layer freeze and thaw in boreal and arctic zones. Temporal observation  frequency must be 2-3 days to resolve the phase transitions in seasonally frozen soils.  Because of small-scale spatial variations of permafrost, resolutions of tens of meters are  required.      b) How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the  value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs?    Jointly acquired airborne L-band and P-band SAR data at a sufficiently representative set  of locations in Alaska and Canada are needed to test and fine-tune retrieval algorithms for  permafrost soil profile conditions. They will also be needed to understand the spatial and  temporal sampling requirements of a prospective spaceborne mission. Additionally, more  extensive ground-based data to establish temporal and spatial variabilities of permafrost  soil characteristics are needed. This effort is being partly supported by the NASA  ABoVE project, described under (a). ABoVE, kicked off in 2015, is planning for an 8-10  year horizon of field and aircraft remote sensing activities, which coincides well with the  period of study of the current Decadal Survey.       c) The anticipated scientific and societal benefits    Multi-year (5-10 years), spatially consistent (meters to tens of meters), and temporally  dense (daily-weekly) observations of permafrost soil and active layer depth are key to  understanding arctic and boreal ecosystems, their dynamics, and the feedbacks affecting  global climate variability. Information on loss or reduction of permafrost will help us  address the impacts of such change on infrastructure in northern communities due to  unstable ground, so that proper adaptation strategies can be developed. It will allow  investigations and predictions of potential positive feedbacks to climate warming trends  due to the release of stored organic soil carbon as a result of thawing. It will also enable  the understanding of possible landcover change due to loss or reduction of permafrost.      d) The science communities that would be involved.    Observations, characterization, modeling, and predictions of permafrost system dynamics  are of great importance to, and will involve, the following communities: terrestrial  ecology, carbon cycle science, hydrology, remote sensing, arctic change, earth system  modelers, exploration geophysics, land-cover and land-use change.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science   across the spectrum of basic research, applied research,  applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?     Over   the   next   decade,   the   dramatic   growth   of   NASA’s   Earth   Science   data   collections   is   projected   to   outpace   the   ability   of   scientists   to   analyze   that   data   meaningfully.      What   has   been   termed   the   “Vs”   of   data   (volume,   variety,   velocity,   etc.)   pose   significant   challenges   for   both   Earth   Science   missions   and   researchers   as   traditional   methods   for   developing   science   data   pipelines,   distributing   scientific   datasets,   and   performing   effective   analysis   will   require   new   approaches.   The   Intergovernmental   Panel   on   Climate   Change’s   (IPCC)   Assessment   Report   6,   for   example,   predicts   the   growth   of   data   to   tens   of   petabytes.   Future   remote   sensing   projects   include   an   increasing   set   of   data-­‐intensive   instruments   that   will   scale   from   the   100s   of   TBs   to   many   several   petabytes   (e.g.,   NISAR   is   estimated   to   be   in   the   80   PB   range)   posing   severe   challenges   to   an   observing   system   that   was   not   designed   for   such   a   data   intensive   challenge.   For   Earth   Science   data   archives,   these   massive   increases   demand   a   shift   of   focus   from   distributing   whole   data   sets   to   providing   online   services   for   computation   and   analysis.   In   addition,   instruments   flown   on   NASA   Earth-­‐observing   satellites   will   continue   to   generate   more   and   more   data   and   stress   the   boundaries   of   end-­‐to-­‐end   data   systems.      These   challenges   taken   together   require   new   thinking   in   data   capture,   management,   processing,   and   analysis,   both   onboard   and   on   the   ground,   for   how   data   systems   can   leverage   data-­‐driven   methodologies.    Currently,   the   analysis   of   large   data   collections   from   NASA   or   other   agencies   is   executed   through   traditional   computational   and   data   analysis   approaches,   which   require   users   to   bring   data   to   their   desktops   and   perform   local   data   analysis.       Alternatively,   data   are   hauled   to   large   computational   environments   that   provide   centralized   data   analysis   via   traditional   High   Performance   Computing   (HPC).   Scientific   data   archives,   however,   are   not   only   growing   massive,   but   are   also   becoming   highly   distributed.      As   a   consequence,   neither   traditional   approach   provides   a   good   solution   for   optimizing   analysis   into   the   future.   Further,   assumptions   across   the   NASA   mission   and   science   data   lifecycle,   which   historically   assume   that   all   data   can   be   collected,   transmitted,   processed,   and   archived,   will   not   scale   as   more   capable   instruments   stress   legacy-­‐based   systems.   A   new   paradigm   is   needed   in   order   to   increase   the   productivity   and   effectiveness   of   scientific   data   analysis.   This   paradigm   must   recognize   that   architectural   and   analytical   choices   are   interrelated,   and   must   be   carefully   coordinated   in   any   system   that   aims   to   allow   efficient,   interactive   scientific   exploration   and   discovery   to   exploit   massive   data   collections,   from   point   of   collection   (e.g.,   onboard)   to   analysis   and   decision   support.   Expanding   on   this   point,   the   most   effective   approach   to   analyzing   a   distributed   set   of   massive   data   may   involve   some   exploration   and   iteration,   putting   a   premium   on   the   flexibility   afforded   by   the   architectural   framework.      The   framework   should   enable   scientist   users   to   assemble   workflows   efficiently,   manage   the   uncertainties   related   to   data   analysis   and   inference,   and   optimize   deep-­‐dive   analytics   to   enhance   scalability.   These   challenges   are   not   limited   to   NASA.      Multiple   agencies   are   confronted   with   the   question   of   how   to   draw   scientific   inference   from   growing,   distributed   archives   [1].       In   2015,   the   NASA   Advanced   Information   Systems   Technology   (AIST)   Program   performed   a   Big   Data   Study   [2],   entitled   “NASA   Earth   Science   Research   in   Data   and   Computational   Science   Technologies”,   identifying   several   trends   as   NASA   continues   to   move   towards   a   data-­‐intensive   agency,   particularly   for   Earth   Science   missions   and   research.      The   study   expanded   on   a   road   mapping   effort   conducted   by   the   NASA   Office   of   Chief   Technologist   that   included   needed   technologies   in   Modeling,   Simulation   and   Information   Technology   [3].   Critical   points   of   the   AIST   study   pointed   to   the   need   to   look   at   the   role   of   scalable   data   and   computational   technologies   across   the   entire   data   lifecycle,   from   point   of   collection   all   the   way   to   extracted   understanding   of   the   data.      In   many   cases,   this   “data   ecosystem”   needs   to   be   able   to   integrate   multiple   observing   assets,   ground   environments,   archives,   and   analytics,   as   a   shift   from   stewardship   of   measurements   of   data   to   using   computational   methodologies   to   better   derive   insight   from   the   data   that   may   be   fused   with   other   sets   of   data.         The   movement   to   such   a   capability   requires   a   careful   set   of   steps   and   a   roadmap   for   shifting   the   paradigm.      The   results   of   the   study   were   shared   as   part   of   a   larger   workshop   on   Data   and   Computational   Science   in   October   2015   at   the   IEEE   Conference   on   Big   Data   [4].          Overall,   we   believe   that   NASA   should   consider   the   following   as   driving   needs   to   ensure   it   is   prepared   for   the   next   decade:    • Scale   Computational   and   Data   Infrastructures   for   future   Earth   Science   mission   and   research   needs.    • Support   the   application   of   automated   data   science   methods,   including   statistical   and   machine   learning   intelligence,   for   deriving   scientific   inferences,   coupled   with   quantifying   the   uncertainty   of   such   inferences.    • Shift   towards   integrated   data   analytics   where   data   from   multiple   measurements   across   archives   can   be   brought   together   to   answer   specific   science   and   applications   questions   and   needs.    • Apply   computational   and   data   science   capabilities   across   the   data   lifecycle,   from   flight   to   ground   to   analysis,   to   address   increasing   data   demands   from   instruments,   ground   systems,   and   users.    • Develop   capabilities   that   can   scale   appropriately   to   support   different   types   of   measurements   from   satellite   to   airborne   to   in   situ.        2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with  respect to readiness? A   Data   Science   Working   Group,   first   established   at   JPL,   and   expanded   as   part   of   the   NASA   AIST   Big   Data   Study,   identified   several   use   cases   that   present   challenges   to   future   NASA   missions   and   science   research   as   shown   in   Table   1.   These   use   cases   identify   capabilities   that   are   needed   in   order   to   not   just   keep   pace   but   increase   the   science   yield   from   NASA   Earth   Science   missions,   instruments   and   data   collections.      They   identify   the   need   to   consider   new   paradigms   for   how   to   construct   a   data   intensive   observing   system   including   high   performance   spaceflight   computing,   on-­‐board   computational   capabilities   for   event   detection   and   data   reduction,   scalable   communications   infrastructures   for   both   flight   and   ground,   ground   systems   coupled   with   intelligent   algorithms   for   feature   and   event   detection,   massively   scalable   computational   infrastructures   (e.g.,   high   performance   computing)   and   archives,   and   distributed   data   analytics   built   on   data   discovery   techniques   to   support   understanding   of   massive   data   collection   coupled   with   interactive   methods   for   visualization.           Table   1:   Data   Science   Challenges   in   Different   Earth   Science   Areas     Use Case/  Area   Description Data Science  Challenge   Enabling Mission/ Capability   Climate  Modeling   Formulate hypotheses from observed empirical  relationships;  Simulate current and past conditions under those  hypotheses using climate models; Test hypotheses  by comparing simulations to observations;   Highly distributed  data sources; fusion  of different  observations; moving  computation to the   CMIP6 will move towards  exascale archives requiring  new approaches to evaluating  models relative to  observational data.

Naval Research Laboratory   3NASA Goddard Space Flight Center  4Pacific Northwest National Laboratory   5University of Maryland, Baltimore County  6University of Hawai’i at Manoa   7University of Arizona    Nearly every cloud on Earth is formed by condensation of water vapor onto small  aerosol particles called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  However, as the 2007  National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey in Earth science and applications  from space noted, “…the interactions between the chemical and physical  properties of condensation nuclei aerosols and cloud water and ice, with the  ensuing formation of a variety of precipitation patterns, are not adequately  understood, modeled, or predicted.”  Since that survey our ability to model the  interaction between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation has advanced across a  range of scales from simulations of individual clouds and cloud systems to global  climate models (GCMs).  This progress has been facilitated by laboratory studies,  measurements from ground-based observatories, and data obtained during field  campaigns with instrumented aircraft and ships, at times supplemented by  observations from existing satellite systems such as AMSR-E, CALIPSO, CloudSat,  and MODIS in the A-Train.  Concurrently, there has developed a greater  appreciation for the interaction among different processes relating aerosols, clouds,  and precipitation with radiation in the atmosphere.  For example, changes in  anthropogenic emissions couple to changes in aerosol concentrations, which in  turn couple to changes in cloud droplet number, which ultimately affects how  clouds reflect solar radiation.  These interactions are complicated by the impact of  meteorology and large-scale motion on the generation, transport, and removal of  aerosols, and cloud formation and precipitation processes.   It has long been recognized that space-based observations are fundamental to  improving our understanding and ability to model aerosol-cloud-precipitation  effects in the Earth’s atmosphere.  Ground-based observations provide limited  geographical coverage, and field campaigns are typically spatially and temporally  constrained.  Space-based observations provide the capability to study large-scale  geographic variations around the globe, examine seasonal cycles, and observe     long-term changes.  However, progress in these areas has been stymied by the  difficulty of observing important aspects of aerosols and their interactions in the  atmosphere from space, including details of the vertical distribution of aerosols,  activation by aerosol species, ambient supersaturation, the presence of giant CCN,  and turbulence and entrainment processes.  It is further critical to observe the  important aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions as they evolve over time – from  the so-called Lagrangian perspective – which is impossible to accomplish with  temporally instantaneous observations provided by a satellite in low Earth orbit  (LEO).   In 2007, the NRC Earth science decadal survey identified aerosol-cloud  interactions as the largest source of uncertainty in GCMs.  This evaluation had not  changed by the time of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013, which found that aerosol-cloud interactions  continued to be the largest source of uncertainty in model calculations of total  radiative forcing.  While GCMs are key to future predictions of climate change – important for understanding the societal impacts of a changing world – according  to the IPCC report there remains low confidence in the representation and  quantification of cloud and aerosol processes in these models.  To reduce GCM  uncertainty it is critical to have suitable and reliable observational constraints, but  it is not sufficient to simply tune the models into agreement with observations.   Instead, a better fundamental understanding of the complex, underlying micro- and  macro-physical processes is required, leading to their appropriate model  representation.  This is especially important as the spatial resolution of GCMs  continues to improve and new parameterizations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation  processes continue to be developed and implemented.   The 2007 NRC decadal survey recommended three missions in the 2013-2020  timeframe related to the societal challenges of climate prediction and air quality:  the Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) mission, the Geostationary Coastal and Air  Pollution Events (Geo-CAPE) mission, and the Global Atmospheric Composition  Mission (GACM).  The ACE mission was endorsed to “narrow the uncertainty in  climate predictions and improve the capability of models to provide more precise  predictions of local climate change, including changes in rainfall.”  Unfortunately,  for a variety of reasons NASA has pushed the ACE mission out beyond the 2020  timeframe.  Although the instruments proposed for the ACE mission – an aerosol  lidar; a multiangle, multiwavelength, polarimetric imager; and a cloud radar –  would greatly enhance our understanding of the interactions between aerosols,  clouds, and precipitation, a single LEO satellite is incapable of resolving aerosol- cloud-precipitation processes that occur on time scales of minutes.  The Geo-CAPE  mission could address the timescale issue by making observations from a  geostationary orbit.  This mission, however, seems to have been largely supplanted  by the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument,  selected by NASA as part of its Earth Venture Instrument (EVI) program, which was     instituted in response to the 2007 NRC decadal survey.  Unfortunately, the spatial  resolution (around 8 km x 4.5 km) and temporal sampling (1 hour) are insufficient  to observe aerosol-cloud interactions at the appropriate scales, which are on the  order of tens of meters and tens of minutes.  Information on aerosol vertical  distribution and composition would also be limited.  Instruments in geostationary  orbit, which are about 50 times farther away from Earth than instruments in LEO,  typically trade spatial resolution and sensitivity for temporal sampling.  For the  GACM mission, which does not currently appear on NASA’s future missions  schedule, the 2007 NRC decadal survey recognized that to measure “profiles of  aerosols and atmospheric structure to better than 150 m, an active system operating  in a polar LEO is required.”  Some of the recommended capabilities will be  realized by the atmospheric lidar (ATLID) on the joint European Space  Agency/Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (ESA/JAXA) Earth Clouds, Aerosol  and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission scheduled for launch in 2018.  Further  assets, such as a multiangle polarimetric imager and an ultraviolet-visible-near  infrared sounder, will fly on ESA’s Sentinel satellites in the next few years as part of  the Copernicus program.   However, even with these investments, particularly by international agencies, the  ability to address the problem of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions through  improved understanding atmospheric processes will be greatly constrained due to  insufficient spatial or temporal resolution or insufficient instrument sensitivity –  particularly in the lowest part of the atmosphere.  The way forward – which  demands contributions from a broad range of science communities including  laboratory and theoretical work, instrument and algorithm development, and field  deployment – requires a dedicated constellation of satellites in LEO along with  coordinated field campaigns that can establish robust statistical relationships  among observable quantities that can then be used to unravel the underlying  micro- and macro-physical processes that fundamentally couple aerosols, clouds,  and precipitation in the Earth’s atmosphere.  The essential space-based  observations include sensitive cloud profiling radars, aerosol lidars, and multiangle  polarimetric imagers on multiple satellites working together.  Constellations of  small satellites have been proposed to the NASA Earth Venture Missions (EVM) call  by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other institutions.  These concepts take  advantage of improvements in the capabilities of micro satellites (CubeSats),  miniaturization of instrument hardware, economies of scale that allow multiple  instruments to be built for less than the cost of multiple units, and technologies  permitting many satellites to be delivered into orbit on a single launch vehicle.  A  new generation of highly sensitive, technically capable, micro-satellite suitable,  active and passive instruments is getting ready for space demonstration via the  NASA InVEST program and others.  NASA also solicits proposals for Earth Venture  Sub-orbital (EVS) projects and has funded field campaigns such as DISCOVER-AQ  with the goal of better understanding aerosols and their impact on air quality, and  ORACLES, which will look at the relationship between biomass burning aerosols     and clouds.  The NASA Earth Venture program could benefit by creating stronger  links between EVM space-based missions and EVS sub-orbital projects.   A combination of a constellation of micro satellites able to observe the details of  aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions with sufficient spatial resolution at intervals  within a period of 30 minutes or so with well-coordinated suborbital aircraft, ship- based, and ground-based measurements would substantially help address GCM  uncertainty in future predictions of climate change, including sea level rise and  changes in water availability.  While large-scale, independent, single-satellite  missions have their role, now is the time to take a more focused approach to the  problem of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in the climate system because  now we know what we don’t know.   Summary    1. What are the key challenges for Earth System Science in the coming decade?    One key challenge is reducing the uncertainty in the representation of aerosol- cloud-precipitation interactions in GCMs to improve the fidelity of these models for  predicting the societal impacts of future climate change.  Fundamental to  addressing this challenge is a detailed understanding of the important aerosol- cloud-precipitation processes as they evolve over time in the Earth’s atmosphere.    2. Why is this challenge timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?    GCMs are continually improving in terms of their spatial resolution and  representation of atmospheric processes, and it is critical to have suitable and  reliable observational constraints.  Recent technological advances are mature  enough for capable instruments to be incorporated into a constellation of micro  satellites that can observe aerosol-cloud-precipitation processes over time.   Coordinating this information with suborbital observations will yield results beyond  what is possible from existing and proposed single satellite systems.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing this challenge?    Space-based observations provide the capability to study large-scale geographic  variations around the globe, examine seasonal cycles, and observe long-term  changes.  However, space-based observations alone will be insufficient to address  the challenge of better understanding aerosol-cloud-precipitation processes due to  the difficulty of observing important micro- and macro-physical details.  Therefore,  close coordination between space-based and suborbital observations is critical.

Fossil fuel combustion and other human  activities have increased the atmospheric carbon  dioxide (CO2) concentration by over 40% since  1800. Over half of that increase has occurred  over the past 30 years and the rate has  accelerated recently as fossil fuel use has  increased in the developing world. Interestingly,  as CO2 emissions have increased, natural “sinks”  in the ocean and land biosphere have continued  to absorb over half of the CO2 emitted by human  activities.  The ground-based CO2 monitoring  network accurately tracks the CO2 buildup on  hemispheric to global scales and shows that the  CO2 uptake by natural sinks varies from year to  year. However, this network does not have the  resolution or coverage needed to quantify  discrete emission sources or identify regional  scale sinks or the processes that control their  variability.    One way to improve the resolution and coverage of this network is to collect precise  measurements of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2, from satellites.  This is a challenging remote sensing measurement, particularly for estimating surface  CO2 fluxes, as these must be inferred from the small perturbations that they produce in  the background CO2 distribution. Even the most intense sources and sinks rarely  produce XCO2 variations larger than 2% (8 parts per million, ppm, out of the 400 ppm  CO2 background) and most produce variations no larger than 0.25% (1 ppm) on scales  of 100 km2 or more.  High precision is therefore essential.  Absolute accuracy and a  connection to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) CO2 scale are also  required so that these data can be integrated with ground-based in-situ measurements.    The Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and NASA Orbiting  Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) were the first two missions designed specifically to  measure XCO2 with the precision, accuracy, and coverage needed to quantify CO2 fluxes  on regional scales (1000 km by 1000 km) over the globe.  GOSAT has been operating  since 2009, returning about 1000 XCO2 estimates each day with single sounding  precisions near 0.5% (2 ppm).  Since September 2014, OCO-2 has been returning   • Regional sources and sinks of  carbon remain a large source  of uncertainty in our  understanding of the carbon  cycle and limit predictive  capability.   • Continuity of XCO2 data are  critical to understanding the  drivers of interannual  variability in carbon sources  and sinks.   • We describe a strategy that is  centered on the cross  calibration of international  remote sensing instrument to  achieve this continuity.        2     hundreds of thousands of XCO2 estimates each day with single sounding precisions of  0.5 ppm. To validate the accuracy of the measurements and connect them to the WMO  CO2 scale, the GOSAT and OCO-2 XCO2 estimates have used those from the ground  based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).       Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with  respect to readiness?   At the time or writing, GOSAT is almost 2 years beyond its nominal, 5-year lifetime,  and OCO-2 is more than half way through its nominal 2-year mission. A much longer,  continuous record is needed to understand how CO2 sources and sinks might evolve in  response to climate drivers such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal  Oscillation, large-scale droughts and floods, and enhanced growing seasons in the  rapidly warming boreal ecosystems. Meanwhile, policy makers are now urgently  seeking new methods to monitor the efficacy of carbon reduction strategies. To address  these needs, long-term, sustained XCO2 observations are highlighted in the pre-Decadal  Survey Workshop on the Climate-Carbon System (U. Oklahoma, March 2015).     Continuity of an accurate, dense, global CO2 data record can be achieved by  deploying long-lived sensors, or by careful cross calibration of instruments with shorter  lifetimes.  In both cases, results from these sensors must be validated against  international standards, such as the WMO CO2 standard, so that they can be combined  with in situ surface and aircraft CO2 measurements and flux tower data. For GOSAT  and OCO-2, TCCON is the transfer standard to meet this requirement.  Future missions  could use a similar approach if TCCON is maintained.    In spite of these needs and capabilities, NASA currently has no firm plans or funding  for future CO2 missions.  NASA had planned to install the OCO-2 flight spare instrument  on the International Space Station as the OCO-3 mission, but, there was no NASA  funding for OCO-3 in FY15, and no budget is in place yet for FY16. If funding is  restored, OCO-3 could still fly later this decade, but its 3-year mission would not extend  through the time period addressed by this Decadal Survey.   Other space agencies are planning to launch a few CO2 missions.  The Chinese  Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) plan to  launch the TanSat satellite into the 705 km Afternoon Constellation (A-Train) in July of  2016.  During its 3-year nominal mission, TanSat will acquire XCO2 measurements at 2 x  2 km resolution along a 20 km wide swath with a precision of 1 to 4 ppm.  However,  TanSat team members still do not have permission from the Chinese government to  share data or to participate in international efforts to cross calibrate measurements or to  validate their CO2 products.  There are also significant legal barriers to direct  collaboration between NASA and TanSat team.     The GOSAT partners at the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),  National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) and Ministry of the Environment of  Japan (MoE) plan to launch GOSAT-2 in 2018.  During its 5-year mission, GOSAT-2 will  measure carbon monoxide (CO) as well as CO2 and methane.  It will collect about twice  as many useful soundings as GOSAT and each sounding will have roughly 4 times the  precision (0.5 ppm for CO2).  The GOSAT partners have also started formulating the        3     GOSAT-3 mission for a launch around 2023, but the requirements for that mission have  not yet been finalized.   The French Space Agency, CNES, is formulating a mission called MicroCarb, which  could be selected for development in the near future.  MicroCarb could be deployed in  the A-Train as early as 2020, providing an excellent opportunity to extend the OCO-2  CO2 data record.  It will collect soundings at 1 Hz along a narrow path, yielding 30 km2  footprints (~10 times the area as OCO-2 footprint) with a single sounding precision of  0.6 ppm.  MicroCarb will have a data density about 10 times larger than GOSAT or  GOSAT-2, but 1/10 as large as OCO-2 or OCO-3.     Two other CO2 missions have been studied for deployment beyond 2023.  The  European Space Agency (ESA) selected CarbonSat as a candidate for the 8th ESA  Earth Explorer (EE8).  CarbonSat was to launch around 2023 and measure both XCO2  and XCH4 at high spatial resolution (6 km2/footprint) over a broad (~200 km) swath to  cover the entire Earth’s surface each month.  Unfortunately, in September 2015, the  ESA Science Advisory Committee (ESAC) did not recommend CarbonSat for the EE8  opportunity, so its future is uncertain.   The previous NASA decadal survey selected the Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions  over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission as a Tier 2 option.  Unlike the  sensors listed above, ASCENDS uses a lidar to measure XCO2.  The spatial coverage  and precision of this approach is lower than that of passive spectrometers, like OCO-2  over the sunlit hemisphere, but it provides the only method that can measure XCO2 at  night or over high latitudes in winter.  While the specific instrument and mission  architecture are not yet known, studies are targeting a measurement precision of ~1  ppm over 10-second integrations along the orbit path in cloud-free conditions.  The  priority of this class of instruments in the next Decadal Survey is unknown.   The value of this suite of missions could be substantially improved if their data can  be combined to yield a uniform, continuous, CO2 climate data record spanning more  than a decade.  To do this, their measurements must be cross-calibrated, and their XCO2  estimates must be cross-validated against internationally-accepted standards (e.g.  WMO, TCCON).  This approach has been demonstrated for the GOSAT and OCO-2  missions.  Based on the success of this activity, NASA and the GOSAT partners have  extended this arrangement to GOSAT-3 (and 2?), with a formal Memorandum of  Understanding, signed in March 2015.  Preliminary agreements to facilitate this type of  collaboration were also executed between the OCO-2, OCO-3 and the CNES  MicroCarb and ESA CarbonSat missions. In spite of their potential value, there is no  funding targeted to maintain the OCO/GOSAT cross-calibration, to maintain TCCON, or  to extend these programs to future missions.  We strongly recommend that these  activities be included as an integral part of the next Decadal Survey.     Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?   Only the vantage point of space can provide the spatial coverage and density of  measurements needed for global flux inversion of CO2. The GOSAT/OCO-2 data record  is being analyzed by a growing, interdisciplinary community of scientists, whose results  are beginning to yield important insights into regional scale CO2 sources and sinks.  To        4     continue this progress, the existing data record must be extended well beyond the  lifetimes of these two pioneering missions.       A flight of the OCO-2 spare instrument, OCO-3, is in NASA’s planning documents for  the allocation of space on the International Space Station Japanese External Module  (JEM-EF). But, there was no NASA funding for OCO-3 in FY15, and no budget is in  place yet for FY16. Several other space agencies are planning to launch XCO2 satellites  over the next half decade.  Given these resources, linking together multiple  measurement sets is the most feasible approach for developing a sustained time series  of XCO2. This approach will not satisfy the growing need for a more capable, dedicated,  constellation of CO2 monitoring satellites, but it will provide the data needed to answer  critical questions about the sensitivity of CO2 sources and sinks to climate change on  regional scales.

Improved ABL parameterizations will lead to better weather/climate forecasts.  Detailed observations of ABL temperature and water vapor structure are essential for  progress. These observations are not yet available from space but are within our grasp in  the next 10 years.    Key Challenges: The Atmospheric Boundary Layer  The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the turbulent layer adjacent to the ocean, land  and ice surface that mediates the interactions between the surface and the troposphere.  The ABL depth varies depending on the nature and intensity of turbulence, but to first  order is 1 to 2 km in ABL convective regimes.    The ABL is at the heart of key climate science challenges:    • Cloud-climate feedback (how clouds will respond and impact climate with increased   greenhouse gas concentration) is essentially about the interactions between a highly  turbulent flow with water phase transitions and radiation, often occurring in the ABL;   • The extreme weather and climate change problem is essentially about how deep moist  convection, with its roots in the ABL, will respond to a warmer world;   • The exchanges of energy, water and carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, land, and  ice are mediated by turbulent fluxes in the ABL;     The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reiterated that clouds are at  the heart of the most significant source of uncertainty in current climate projections. ABL  clouds play a key role in this cloud-climate feedback problem. Clouds are explicitly  dependent on ABL temperature and water vapor structure, and more accurate knowledge  of this structure is necessary to solve this problem.     In addition, the ABL plays a central role in all four guiding questions of the WCRP  Grand Challenge on Clouds, Circulation, and Climate Sensitivity (Bony et al., 2015): (1)        2     What role does convection play in cloud feedbacks? (2) What controls the position,  strength, and variability of the storm tracks? (3) What controls the position, strength and  variability of the tropical rain bands? And (4) what role does convective aggregation play  in climate?     Humans live in the ABL and the weather that we experience has a tremendous impact on  our health, safety and economy. Weather forecasts are routinely produced by numerical  weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world. The ABL plays a critical role in key  weather events. The recent NASA Weather Focus Area community workshop report  (Zeng et al., 2015) highlights the importance of the ABL for weather, and some key  unsolved questions: How does moist convection interact with the ABL and the surface?  What are the fundamental mechanisms controlling ABL clouds?    Acting as a buffer between the surface and the free troposphere, the ABL regulates  atmospheric composition. Important processes (e.g. aerosol physics, entrainment) depend  on ABL turbulence and convection, and its interplay with composition, radiation and  clouds. In the context of applications, the ABL plays a key role in air quality as its  turbulence and convection determine the transport of atmospheric constituents. Several  other applications (e.g. health, renewable energy) require greater understanding of the  ABL.     A long-term goal in the physics of weather and climate models is the development of  accurate parameterizations that represent the processes associated with ABL turbulence,  moist convection and clouds. However, current weather and climate models are still a  long way away from realistically representing the ABL and many problems remain to be  solved. Although some of these problems are theoretical, solving the key issues would  benefit tremendously from better space observations of the fundamental properties of the  ABL.     Timeliness  There are a few key reasons why this fundamental ABL challenge is timely to address in  the next 10 years. First, it is absolutely essential to produce climate change projections  that are much less uncertain than they are today. In this context, it is urgent to solve  problems such as cloud-climate feedback. In order to be successful in addressing these  goals a much better knowledge of the ABL is necessary. More detailed observations of  the vertical structure of the ABL from space are essential.     From the NWP and data-assimilation perspective, it is now clear that, although far from  perfect, current ABL parameterizations in NWP models are much improved compared to  a few years ago. These better NWP models will allow for the assimilation of space-based  ABL observations in a much more effective manner.     Solar and wind power are now major players in renewable energy production. In order to  optimize energy production using wind and solar power, there is a crucial need for better  ABL observations, which will lead to more accurate wind and solar power forecasts.          3     Space-Based Observations  The ABL is a global feature, including the world’s oceans and remote land regions where  in-situ observations are rare. For a global characterization of the ABL, space-based  observations are essential. Since the ABL is often dominated by convective mixing, the  ABL temperature and water vapor vertical structure determine and characterize many of  the key physical processes (e.g. entrainment, clouds). To realistically characterize the  ABL, from a global perspective, there is an urgent need for more accurate observations of  the vertical profiles of ABL temperature and water vapor.    Surface evaporation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes mediate the water and energy  exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. Improved estimates from space of  surface heat, water and carbon fluxes are essential to improve weather and climate  forecasts. Key components of surface fluxes calculations are the observations of  temperature and water vapor close to the surface.    Existing space-based methods for remote sensing of temperature and water vapor profiles  include passive infrared (IR) sounding, passive microwave (MW) sounding and radio  occultation (RO) approaches. Each of these methods is extremely useful for assimilation  in NWP and for climate analysis. Despite their successes, the current incarnations of  these methods have limitations that preclude them from accurately profiling ABL  temperature and water vapor. Current IR and MW sounding has fairly coarse horizontal  resolution and broad weighting functions in the ABL. Additionally, clouds are frequent in  the ABL, which influences IR spectra. RO is sensitive to ABL water vapor with high  vertical resolution. However the utility of RO is challenged by an additional dependence  on pressure and temperature, sampling issues and an even coarser horizontal resolution.      Given the recent history of the enormous impact of MW, IR and RO sounding in  improving NWP forecasts, there is little doubt that more detailed information on the ABL  temperature and water vapor structure, would have an additionally significant impact on  weather forecasts. In fact, and in spite of the impact of current observations, few ABL  observations are currently assimilated in NWP. This implies that much of the ABL  structure produced by these models (which are also the source of re-analyses) derives  directly from the parameterizations, with their implied model biases.      The recent NASA Weather Focus Area community workshop report (Zeng et al., 2015)  recommends that continuous investment in temperature and water vapor profile  measurements from space is needed, focusing on higher spatial and temporal resolution,  and synergistic measurements involving multiple instruments, and different platforms  (including small-sat and cubesats). The report states that in particular better  measurements of ABL temperature and water vapor are needed.     However, currently planned national and international missions do not explicitly target  the improvement of measurements of ABL vertical structure of temperature and water  vapor and as such are not responsive to the needs discussed in this white paper.     Recent work using current technologies (IR, MW and RO) with higher spatial and        4     temporal resolutions is encouraging, particularly when combined in an optimal way to  probe more effectively into the ABL. Ultra high-resolution (order 100 m) IR sounders  would be revolutionary in terms of temperature and water vapor horizontal structure, and  would also produce more information on the vertical structure by finding many more  clear regions, and using higher horizontal resolution to provide additional information on  the vertical structure. New RO receiver technology currently under development would  lead to improved accuracy and sensitivity within the ABL. Advances in technology, from  the visible through the microwave spectrum, have recently enabled active sounding of  water vapor in clear sky and within the cloudy ABL.      In summary, to solve key weather and climate ABL challenges, there is an urgent need  for more accurate observations of ABL temperature and water vapor structure. This can  be achieved in the next 10 years by investing in (i) optimal combinations of improved  technologies that are currently already in use (e.g. higher resolutions and temporal  sampling of IR, MW, RO approaches); and (ii) new technologies using active sensors.      Anticipated Science and Societal Benefits and Science Communities  As discussed above, the anticipated benefits of improved global observations of the ABL  structure of temperature and water vapor are significant, from the weather, climate and  applications perspective. For example, solving the cloud-climate feedback problem,  which is deeply connected to the cloudy ABL, is of great urgency to improve climate  projections.     The science communities associated with these essential weather and climate topics  would be heavily involved in, and would greatly benefit from, this endeavor. The  applications community (e.g. health, renewable energy) would be greatly served by the  more detailed ABL measurements that are advocated in this white paper. These  communities are part of research and development activities across a variety of agencies  such as NASA, NOAA, NSF, DOE, EPA and DOD.

These changes are degrading the functioning of terrestrial                        ecosystems​3 and causing increasingly profound impacts on the Earth system and                      ecosystem services​4,5​. The international community has called for urgent action to address                        the problem of dangerous biodiversity loss​6,7 including functional biodiversity loss​8​.                    Functional biodiversity represents the variation in biological structures and functions,                    including key plant traits like leaf morphology and biochemical composition (e.g. leaf                        nitrogen content). These traits are functionally related to plant growth rates, phenology,                        tolerances to climatic stress, mortality, and ultimately, the fate of vast amounts of carbon                            currently stored in plant biomass and soils. Functional diversity is strongly associated                        with taxonomic and phylogenetic measures of biodiversity​9,10​, but links more directly to                        ecosystem processes including carbon, water and energy exchange with the atmosphere                      and can thus feed more directly into Earth system models​11​. Understanding the functional                          composition and diversity of Earth’s ecosystems, particularly its forests, is vitally                      important for tracking the status and resilience of Earth’s ecosystems, and for predicting                          how these life support systems will function in the future. We currently lack the global                              scale data we need to do so. Without such data, we cannot track changes in functional                                biodiversity now and into the future or effectively connect functional biodiversity                      knowledge with existing models of Earth systems.   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to                        readiness?   Currently­available global functional biodiversity data are grossly incomplete and                  non­representative taxonomically, geographically, environmentally, temporally, and            functionally. Datasets on species traits continue to grow​12–14​, but available data for                        vascular plants observed locally under represent the number of species by an order of                            magnitude, conspicuously for species­rich tropical regions (Fig. 1). As a result, the                                   ~100,000 plant species in the megadiverse tropics are represented by only 1­3 plant                          functional types in current Earth System Models, severely curtailing their predictive                      ability on decadal to centennial timescales​15–20​. This spatial and environmental data gap                        and bias is exacerbated by even scarcer data on temporal and geographic variation of                            functional traits within species. Data on other biodiversity attributes such as species                        occurrence, abundance and biomass hold similar biases​21,22​.       Figure 1: ​The data gap­­​latitudinal variation in the richness of all vascular plant  species (black; after​23​ and those with data for at least one trait measured  locally  (white; from TRY​12​, June 2015) within  110km grid cells (N = 11,626).  While species diversity is highest in the tropics, the number of species with no  functional data measured locally is also highest there, limiting understanding of  both biodiversity and of ecosystem function and services.          Even in areas in which current data are relatively complete, widespread biodiversity                        change driven by anthropogenic pressures is rapidly rendering existing data obsolete and                        outpacing gradual information gains afforded by ​in situ ​biodiversity sampling.                    Furthermore, existing “global” data has not been collected consistently or systematically,                      but is instead compiled post hoc from thousands of disparate research activities, often not                            designed to address long­term trends or large­scale patterns. This severe sampling                             inhomogeneity is not readily overcome statistically and continues to impose severe limits                        on inference and application in global biodiversity science​22–24​. An integrated system for                        rapidly and consistently imaging, classifying, mapping and monitoring plant functional                    diversity globally is urgently needed​25​.     The state of technology and science readiness is high. Imaging spectroscopy is a                          well­established, continuously advancing technology capable of monitoring terrestrial                plant functional diversity on a global scale​26–28​. Similar techniques are under development                        for characterizing marine phytoplankton, seagrasses, and coral reefs​29,30​. The                  technological tools, informatics infrastructure, theoretical basis, and analytical capability                  now exist to produce consistent, repeated, global data on functional biodiversity of                        Earth’s ecosystems. Spectroscopic remote sensing offers high­dimensional information ​31​,                  required to move beyond low­dimensional biophysical remote sensing and provide                    information more proportional to the biological diversity (~250,000 plant species) of the                        planet. Spectroscopic measurements will help fill critical knowledge gaps, aid the                      assessment of global environmental change, and improve predictions of future change.                      Continuous, near­global coverage in space and time has the potential to transform basic                          science on diversity and function and redesign capture of the properties of the terrestrial                            biosphere in Earth system models. Now is the time to give this science target highest                              priority.   Why are space­based observations fundamental to addressing these                challenges/questions?   Adequate coverage of plant functional diversity cannot realistically be achieved by                      increasing the investment in ​in situ observations. The areas with sparse present­day                        sampling are large, often have limited accessibility, and require arduous fieldwork by                        trained teams to collect ground­based data. Near populated areas and research field sites,                          approaches such as citizen science or automated cameras can provide some critical data,                          but these techniques cannot be uniformly or broadly applied, and in any case are                            insufficient for observing current high rates of change, tasks for which space­based data                          are ideally suited. Spaceborne measurements can reduce bias errors associated with                      relatively sparse ​in situ ​systems through their spatial coverage and large sample size, and                            can be used to assess bias and extrapolate limited local information. Space­based                        systems can also simultaneously measure drivers of ecological change alongside                    biodiversity and ecosystem responses. The evolution of remote sensing systems that                      combine estimates of drivers of ecological change and ecosystem responses can, in                        concert with appropriate and coordinated ​in situ and calibration/validation efforts, allow                      the testing of ecological theory at previously inaccessible scales. The spatial coverage,                        resolution and direct observation of change, demonstrated for biophysical land surface                      properties by LANDSAT and MODIS, are critical for improving knowledge of global                        ecosystem function using spectroscopic and related techniques.            Do existing and planned U.S. and international programs provide the capabilities                      necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated                      questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?   A number of planned international missions, such as ENMAP (Germany; 2018) and                        HISUI (Japan; 2018), and airborne sensors will have some capability for mapping plant                          functional diversity. However, none of these will provide the repeated global coverage                        needed to monitor functional diversity change through time. The proposed HyspIRI                      mission, called for in Tier 2 of the 2007 Decadal Survey, would provide these                            capabilities. Importantly though, the earliest possible launch of such a space­based                      spectroscopic capability is urgent. A global baseline dataset obtained while                    biogeographic distributions are still in the early stages of change will provide correlations                          between distributions of species’ traits and climate. This dataset will serve as a                          data­based constraint on the sensitivity of many plant species to climate and as an initial                              state of the terrestrial biosphere for prognostic ecosystem models. The sooner such a                          dataset is collected, the more scientific information it will provide​25​.    Investments by NASA, ESA, NSF, the Carnegie Institution, and the University of Zurich                          have developed increasingly capable airborne instruments and built robust algorithms for                      quantifying a growing number of functional diversity attributes. The ​additional                    investment required in the upcoming Decadal Survey era is a robust, relatively long                          duration mission providing global coverage and meeting the spectral measurement                    requirements defined in the literature for accurate and precise retrievals.   How will space­based observations be linked with other observations to increase the                        value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs?   Space­based data alleviate the inherent spatial sampling bias and sparsity of biodiversity                        data in remote regions, but require careful calibration and validation. Assembling                      networks and data sets ​post hoc carries with it the near­certainty of biases: for global                              models where calculating the correct integral or average value is critical this is a                            particularly serious issue​32,33​. Remote observations, contain bias and uncertainty of their                      own and so require careful evaluation against a well­designed ​in situ                      calibration/validation program. Not all variables can be sensed remotely, however.                    Using spectroscopic remote sensing for key properties of the biosphere may allow                        redirection of ​in situ emphasis to equally­important measurements and experiments, on                      soil properties, microbial processes, genomics, and trophic processes. In some cases,                      recent advances in ecological theory and further investments in ground data and modeling                          will enable linking spectral information to these as well as other plant traits that cannot be                                sensed remotely but that are equally important to Earth system prediction.   What are the anticipated scientific and societal benefits​?       Global knowledge of functional diversity is required for a new generation of Earth                          System Models​15–20​. While current models emphasize simulation of processes such as                      evapotranspiration and photosynthesis, long­term ecosystem change is driven more by                    changes to the distribution or types of organisms, which include gross changes mediated                          by differences in function such as from forest to grassland, and subtler changes such as                              replacement of current species by more drought­or­fire tolerant species. These functional                      changes directly affect the global climate and carbon systems, and also lead directly to                            societal benefits, as the functional properties of species and the structure of the resultant                            ecosystems influence the potential for the production of food and fiber, clean water, and                            the spread of human and plant pests and pathogens. There are few cases where the                              current coarse abstraction of plant types (typically less than 20 in global models) provides                            direct insight into the full spectrum of ecosystem services and societal benefits. As                          species and consequent functional properties change more and more rapidly, exploiting                      the proven spectral techniques to track these changes will provide an ever­widening                        spectrum of benefits to humanity.    Regular, timely global biodiversity data has been identified as essential for monitoring                        and enabling progress towards meeting the Aichi targets for averting dangerous                      biodiversity loss set forth by the Convention on Biological Diversity​34–36​. These data will                          be used by the International Science­Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem                      Services (IPBES), an analogue to IPCC, national and regional policy makers, land and                          wildlife managers, non­governmental organizations, and citizen­science communities.    The science communities that would be involved.   Spectroscopic missions, with data products designed to support the understanding of                      global plant functional diversity, will add a new dimension to Earth System Science,                          bringing biodiversity and the functional variations between species, squarely into the                      center of long term Earth System monitoring and prediction, with benefits to ecological                          science and management, and with concurrent benefits to atmospheric science,                    hydrology, health and disease, and agronomy. It would require strengthening the growing                        ties between the remote sensing science and biological communities. This would build                        on very large scientific communities not currently deeply involved with remote sensing                        and Earth System Science: for example the Ecological Society of America has over                          10,000 members in basic and applied ecology, and the Biogeosciences section of the                          American Geophysical Union is one of the fastest­growing components of that society.                        Producing global, repeated observations of plant functional diversity with appropriate                    cal/val and uncertainty would produce a user community on a par with the MODIS­Land                            user community and would include many research areas that are not currently                        well­supported by remote observations.    1.

It summarizes the findings, conclusions and recommendations from the  participants of the 2015 Workshop on Evapotranspiration Mapping for Water Security. The workshop was  convened to: i) capture and highlight progress in the use of satellite data to map ET to address a range of  water resource management challenges in the U.S. and internationally; ii) identify current challenges in  operational use of satellite-derived ET data; and iii) identify the requirements for future satellite missions  to address current and future challenges. The workshop was sponsored by the NASA Applied Sciences  Program and the World Bank and organized by the University of Idaho, University of Nebraska, NASA,  the World Bank, USDA and USGS. The workshop was attended by 154 participants, including scientific  experts on remote sensing of ET, water resources managers, representatives from the agricultural  community and state engineers offices, and consumers of ET data. The workshop agenda and  presentations are available at https://c3.nasa.gov/water/resources/10/. The full list of workshop  contributors and participants is included in Appendix A. This white paper was prepared by the authors on  behalf of the workshop participants. The workshop recommendations and findings were distributed to  workshop participants for review and comment.          2     I.  Societal Benefits of Evapotranspiration Mapping with Satellite Data    There have been great advances within the past several decades in our ability to compute and map ET  over large areas through the use of satellite-based remote sensing and geospatial models.  Within the  U.S., a broad spectrum of federal, state, and local agencies, as well as commercial entities, are making  significant investments in operational use of remotely-sensed ET data to address a wide range of water  resources management challenges. As of 2015, there are at least twenty-two U.S. states where Landsat- based ET data are used for water resources monitoring and management (e.g.,  https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/files/gis/METRIC_in_Other_States.pdf). Use of ET data to address a range of  international water resources management challenges is also rapidly increasing. Examples presented at  the 2015 workshop include applications of ET data for drought monitoring, water planning, estimating  aquifer depletion, water rights compliance, quantifying agricultural water use, irrigation management,  nutrient management, hydrologic modeling, protection of endangered species, legal finding-of-fact,  development of water markets, water rights buy-back, monitoring in-season water demand, and tribal  water rights negotiations.  In each of these applications, use of ET data has supported important  improvements in decision-making and contributed to increased resiliency to a range of threats to water  security and the sustainability of agricultural production. Descriptions of these applications include: Allen  et al. (2007b); Anderson et al. (2012a,b); Kilic et al. (2010, 2012); Burkhalter et al. (2013); Semmens et al.  (2015); and https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/GIS/mapping-evapotranspiration/.     II.  Key Questions    Key science questions associated with satellite mapping of ET to address water and food security  challenges are listed below.       1) What is the consumptive use of water in agriculture at the scale of individual fields, and how is  consumption changing over time?   2) What is the relationship between crop water requirements, water supply, and agricultural  consumptive water use through ET, and how does this affect crop yields?    3) How can we mitigate threats to regional food security through measurement of crop stress from  satellite-derived ET data and its application to provide early warning of crop failure during  drought?   4) Where do long-term imbalances exist between available water supplies and consumptive use of  water by agriculture, and how does this affect both water and food security?   5) Have recent efforts to improve water and food security through construction of water projects and  changes in irrigation water management been successful in maintaining or increasing irrigated  acreage and the reliability of food production, in balance with other water uses including  environmental and municipal?   6) What are the economic benefits of increased efficiency in water management and water transfers  enabled by high frequency satellite-derived ET data at the field-scale?   7) How can satellite-derived ET data be combined with data on precipitation and runoff data to  improve estimates of groundwater recharge?     III.  Why Are These Questions Timely?    As climate change adds further strain on water resources around the world, it is critical that our next  generation of Earth observing satellites not only advances our scientific understanding of the global water  cycle, but also provides data to support water resource managers responding to threats to water security.    Water for irrigated agriculture is by far the largest component of water diverted and consumed in the  United States and globally. Water resource managers are tasked with using available water efficiently,     3   which requires that they know both the maximum amount of water that crops potentially use and the  amount of water actually being used or “consumed” through ET.     In the past decade, severe drought has affected major agricultural regions around the world including  California, the Midwest, Brazil and Australia (Anderson et al., 2015; AghaKouchak et al., 2014; Swain et  al., 2014; Mallya et al., 2013; Saatchii et al., 2013; Dijk et al., 2013) impacting both water supplies and  agricultural production. The IPCC identified increasing risks to food and water security as one of the  primary impacts of accelerating climate change through increasing climate variability and frequency of  extreme events (IPCC, 2014).     It is at the field scale that water rights are generally enacted and contested, and where water  management changes are implemented.  As a consequence, ET information is required at the field scale.  Advances in satellite data processing and modeling of ET have facilitated increasing use of satellite- derived ET information in operational water resources management (Bastiaanssen et al. 1998a,b; Allen et  al., 2007a,b). This move from applied research to operational monitoring and management of water  resources is indicative of the increasing maturity of both the satellite sensors and models required to  estimate ET from satellite observations. The accuracy of satellite derived ET data has been shown to be  sufficient for use in legal disputes over water rights. ET maps generated using Landsat data and the  METRIC model (Allen et al., 2007a,b) have supported judicial decisions that were upheld in reviews by  state Supreme Courts (https://www.idwr.idaho.gov/files/gis/Delivery_Call.pdf), as well as by the U.S.  Supreme Court (State of Montana v. State of Wyoming, et al., No. 137, Original, U.S. Sup. Crt.).      While important progress has been made and benefits have been achieved through the use of satellite- derived ET data, further advances and operational use in some regions have been hampered by a  shortage of cloud-free, high spatial resolution, thermal infrared satellite data required for calculation of  land surface temperature and ET at the field scale. This limitation can be resolved by increasing the  number of satellite observations of land surface temperature at the field scale.     Furthermore, upcoming missions such as ECOSTRESS have the potential to demonstrate one pathway  towards achieving a higher temporal resolution of these measurements.  Mission concepts for free-flying  thermal instruments operating in a constellation with missions like Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 also  demonstrate a cost effective approach for increasing the frequency of retrieval of the full suite of satellite  observations needed to accurately calculate ET. A key challenge for the next Decadal Survey will be to  build upon these mission concepts and technological advances to achieve reliable global, weekly, cloud- free measurements in the visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths at  the field scale.     IV.  Need for Space-based Observations    Space-based remote sensing is the only feasible option for obtaining routine, consistent, field-scale  observations of ET over areas larger than a watershed. ET is highly variable spatially and temporally and  difficult and expensive to measure on the ground.  Surface flux towers typically cost $10,000 to $100,000,  and weighing lysimeters are as expensive.  The expense and difficulty associated with deploying and  maintaining a spatial network of field instrumentation for ET measurement inherently limits its utility for  continuous monitoring over large areas.  Aircraft, including unmanned aerial systems (UAS), offer a range  of promising technologies for precision agriculture where mapping of row-to-row variation in high-value  crops can identify within-field plant stress caused by lack of water, pest infestation or nutrient deficits.  However, future spatial and temporal coverage by UAS and other aircraft will not be broad enough to  produce, at a minimum, new information monthly over large areas, such as the Central Valley of  California or the High Plains Aquifer region of the central U.S., regions of substantial water stress and  water resource depletion.                 4   V.  Specific Recommendations    The Workshop participants urge the NRC Decadal Survey Panel to consider the following specific  recommendations:     1. The U.S. Government should increase its support for Earth Observation satellites that collect  measurements of land surface temperature at the field scale.   2. Future satellites to support water resources management should provide visible and near infrared  data with pixel sizes of ~ 30m x 30m, and thermal infrared pixel sizes of no more than ~100m x  100m.   3. Future satellites, or satellite constellations, producing imagery at the field scale should provide  weekly cloud-free coverage for most regions of the globe.   4. The U.S. Government should continue its open-data policy, which provides free access to all  NASA, USGS, and NOAA satellite data.   5. All countries with thermal infrared satellite imaging capabilities should share their Earth  observation data freely via web interfaces that meet international standards for exchange of  scientific data.   6. The participants commend the USGS for working to minimize data latency for Landsat and other  data, and recommend that US agencies continue to target data availability within 24 hours of data  acquisition and make data accessible through cloud computing resources.    7. A free-flying satellite having at least the standards of the Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor  should be placed in orbit to fly in close proximity to the present and future European Sentinel 2- type satellites, which lack thermal sensing capabilities. In addition, a thermal free-flying satellite  should be launched in close proximity to the orbit of Landsat as a backup for potential failure of  the TIRS thermal imager on Landsat 8 or to provide intervening thermal imagery between  Landsat 7, 8 and 9 overpasses.  These activities should be viewed as a complement to Landsat,  and should not delay the launch of Landsat 9.   8. The International Space Station (ISS) should be considered as a long-term platform for thermal  instruments that provide insight into the diurnal cycle of land surface temperature and ET to  complement field-scale polar-orbiting systems.      Additional Information for Consideration (beyond 1500 words)    VI. Limitations of Current and Future U.S. and International Programs    Summary: Planned satellite measurements will likely provide visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared  data but there remains a scarcity of thermal infrared data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.    Measurement characteristics and temporal resolution:    The spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of instruments onboard the current Landsat 8 mission  are included in Appendix B, along with the specifications for instruments planned to operate from the ISS  as part of the ECOSTRESS mission. Current information on the planned Landsat 9 mission indicates that  the instruments will closely follow Landsat 8 specifications. The growing operational use of Landsat- derived ET information indicates that the spectral bands, spatial resolution, accuracy and precision of the  Landsat 8 instruments are sufficient to support mapping of ET, especially the thermal imagery at sub-field  scale resolution, and future missions should meet or improve upon these sensor specifications.      Daily, weekly, monthly and growing-season ET maps are essential inputs to management of water  resources, water rights, irrigation, and for hydrologic process modeling. Time integration of ET into  datasets and maps representing ET over daily, weekly, monthly and longer time-periods is based on ET     5   obtained as ‘snapshots’ determined on the day of a satellite overpass. The ET ‘snapshots’ require cloud- free image pixels, and increasing the frequency of acquisition of field-scale, cloud-free ET data leads to  direct improvements in the accuracy of ET over time. The probability of obtaining cloud-free pixels within  a relevant period, such as during each one-month period of the growing season, increases twice as fast  as the corresponding imaging frequency of a satellite (Morton et al., 2015). In other words, if a satellite- imaging frequency is doubled so that the repeat-imaging period is halved (e.g., from eight days to four  days), the probability of obtaining a cloud-free image of a location will increase fourfold.     The current temporal resolution and revisit frequency of the existing Landsat satellites is inadequate to  consistently provide at least one cloud-free image per month globally. The ECOSTRESS mission, which  will measure field-scale ET data at different times of day from the ISS, will provide the observations  required to enhance our understanding of the evolution of ET throughout the day, but is only scheduled to  operate on ISS for a short duration. Future satellite missions should increase the temporal resolution of  thermal infrared measurements, at a spatial resolution of 100m or finer, to provide at least one cloud-free  observation per week globally.     Spatial resolution:    Half of U.S. farms are smaller than 18 ha (45 acres), and 80% of U.S. farms are smaller than 95 ha (234  acres) (MacDonald et al., 2013).  Many of these farms are split into smaller parcels to produce multiple  crops.  Even on large farms (which account for the majority of total cultivated acreage in the U.S.), the  largest irrigation management unit would typically be a quarter-section (i.e., 64 ha or 160 acres).   Furthermore, average field size in Africa and across Southern Asia is typically much smaller than in North  America and Europe (Fritz et al., 2015).  Thus, a spatial resolution of 1 ha (100m x 100m) or finer is  required to reliably resolve field-scale ET patterns globally.  This resolution is essential to a wide-range of  applications related to management of water rights and irrigation, all of which occur at the field scale, and  for mapping of drought impacts on crop yields.    Instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra  and Aqua satellites and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi-NPP  satellite provide thermal infrared measurements at spatial scales from 375m to 1000m.  Even at 375m,  this translates to a spatial scale of 14 ha per pixel.  While data from these instruments is useful for  regional hydrologic modeling and drought monitoring, they are too coarse to accurately capture ET at the  scale of individual fields and irrigation management units.           Data latency and data systems:      Short data latency is critical to many operational applications of remotely-sensed ET data products,  including the increasing use of near-real-time ET data in irrigation management (Gowda et al., 2008;  Mendez-Costabel et al., 2012; Melton et al., 2012). The USGS, for example, has a target of making 95%  of all Landsat data available within 24 hours after data acquisition by a satellite.  In practice, most images  are available within a few hours of data acquisition. Maintaining this short data latency is critical to many  operational applications of remotely-sensed ET data products.      Recent advances in cloud and high performance computing represent an important opportunity to  advance the use of satellite-derived ET, especially in developing regions where network bandwidth can  constrain access to satellite data.  Platforms like the NASA Earth Exchange (Nemani et al., 2011) can  support rapid mapping of field-scale of ET from satellite data over regional to continental scales.  Publicly  available cloud computing platforms like Google’s Earth Engine and OpenNEX also allow users to  process satellite data without having to download satellite scenes, thereby removing a key barrier to the  operational use of ET data in regions where network bandwidth or local computing capacity is limited.    VII.  Linking Space-based Observations with Other Observations:    Most models and techniques used to derive daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal ET data from satellite  observations rely on meteorological data as inputs used in time integration. ET data from Earth observing     6   satellites can be used as a key input to inform weather models. ET data can also be combined with  hydrologic models and satellite or surface observations of precipitation, streamflow, topography, soil  texture, and land cover to improve estimates of hydrologic variables, including critically needed estimates  of groundwater recharge.

The OLI is required to produce data  calibrated to an uncertainty of less than 5% in terms of absolute, at-aperture spectral radiance and to an uncertainty  of less than 3% in terms of top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance for each of the spectral bands in Table 1. These  values are comparable to the uncertainties achieved by ETM + calibration. The OLI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)  specifications, however, were set higher than ETM + performance based on results from the ALI. Table 2 lists the  OLI specifications next to ETM + performance (Markham et al., 2003) for ratios at specified levels of typical,  Ltypical, and high, Lhigh, spectral radiance for each spectral band. Commensurate with the higher ratios, OLI will  quantize data to 12 bits as compared to the eight-bit data produced by the TM and ETM + sensors.   Table 2.

The TIRS noise limits are specified in  terms of noise-equivalent-change-in-temperature (NEΔT) rather than the signal-to-noise ratios used for OLI  specifications (Table 4). The radiometric calibration uncertainty is specified to be less than 2% in terms of absolute,  at-aperture spectral radiance for targets between 260 K and 330 K (less than 4% for targets between 240 K and  260 K and for targets between 330 K and 360 K).

This  relaxation was specified to help expedite the TIRS development. The designers were able to save schedule through  more selective redundancy in subsystem components rather than the more robust redundancy required for a five-year  design life.

are many unanswered questions, particularly related to atmospheric convection, such as:   ● How does the vertical distribution of moisture in the troposphere modulate storm mode  and updraft strength?   ● How does evapotranspiration influence available potential energy for convection prior to  storm development?   ● How does the water vapor content of an air mass impact precipitation efficiency?  ● What modulates the rate at which convective storms (of all types) intensify to produce   severe weather, tornadic storms, lightning, and other hazards? (NASA Weather  Workshop Report, 2015)     Space­based observations, especially from the geostationary perspective, are fundamental for  monitoring the spatial and temporal scales of moisture. Vertical profiles of moisture evolve on  short timeframes, hours or less, that few other observational platforms are able to capture, and  none over a vast geographic area, such as the contiguous United States. An advanced infrared  sounder with numerous water vapor bands in the geostationary orbit could contribute radiances  for numerical weather prediction (NWP), derived product imagery of potential value to  operational meteorologists, and supplement surface, aircraft, and radiosonde observations in  better depicting concentrations of moisture that contribute to precipitation.    Beyond that, the ability to sense water vapor in the troposphere is critical for monitoring and  predicting certain hazardous weather conditions. For example, differential water vapor advection  is a typical ingredient that fuels severe thunderstorm outbreaks. Large variations in atmospheric  water vapor occur over a scale of 10 km in the horizontal plane and hundreds of meters in the  vertical plane. Severe thunderstorms, which form mostly over land, evolve on scales of one to  ten minutes (Schmit et al., 2009). Individual storm characteristics are highly dependent on the  extent of water vapor in the surrounding air mass.       a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the  capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and  associated questions. If not, what additional investments are needed?     Currently, there are no existing or planned U.S. weather satellite missions to provide vertical  moisture profiles on both high time and space scales that make substantial progress on the  identified questions. The investments needed are consistent with global attention to launch and  operate high­spectral­resolution infrared­sensing instruments in the geostationary orbit, but  those missions are focused on Europe and Asia.    Operational forecasters in the U.S. have already identified the utility of the three Geostationary  Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Sounder channels in assessing the advection of  the elevated mixed layer (Gitro, personal communication). But this is not sufficient. According to  the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center (SPC), `A major limitation in convective  forecasting is the lack of high resolution [four­dimensional evolution of] water vapor [structures].`  The SPC notes that `lack of necessary detail in mapping water vapor that has been identified by  the [United States Weather Research Program (USWRP)] as major obstacle to improved  [quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF)] and severe weather forecasting` and that `new  sources of accurate and reliable observational data are critical to improve assessment of  environment and convective forecasting` (Weiss, personal communication).     b. How to link space­based observations with other observations to increase the value of  data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs;     To decrease the observational gaps in time and space between radiosondes and aircraft  observations, temperature and moisture profiles derived from weather satellites need to be of  commensurate quality and vertical resolution. Aircraft observations are currently the backbone  of short range NWP forecasting over the U.S. (Benjamin et al., 2010). Nowcasting (focusing on  the imminent evolution of the atmospheric state) and short­term forecasts (within six to nine  hours) of severe thunderstorms could improve with additional vertical moisture information and  rapid scan capabilities in clear skies and above low clouds from a high­spectral­resolution  infrared sounder.    Furthermore, the highest­resolution NWP models are now convection­allowing. In order to  properly initialize these models for operational forecasting, observations on the grid scale (less  than 5 km) are required to improve state/base fields responsible for initiating convection within  the model. Better moisture analyses also have the potential to improve numerical precipitation  forecasts. Accurate moisture analyses can alter forecasted precipitation amounts in NWP  models with parameterized convection as well.     c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and    The socioeconomic impact of improved detection and warning ahead of impactful weather  events is substantial, and evident through a decrease in loss of life to weather­related disasters  over time. Given the precarious position of the central and eastern contiguous United States  between cooler, drier air filtering southward from Canada, and warm, moist air flowing northward  from the Gulf of Mexico that produces unsettled weather, a large segment of the nation’s  population and farmland, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is weather­sensitive.       d. The science communities that would be involved.     With an advanced sounder in the geostationary orbit, there would be many subdisciplines and  related communities within meteorology that would have an opportunity to improve their  foundational understanding of the development of high­impact atmospheric phenomena, many  related to convection, such as mesoscale convective systems, tropical cyclones, and tornadoes.    Beyond characterizing the severity of convection, monitoring the horizontal and vertical  distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is necessary for understanding the details of the  hydrological cycle. Given the need for relatively high temporal resolution, an advanced infrared  sounder in the geostationary orbit is proposed as the best fit to meet this ongoing challenge of  the broad meteorological community.    References and notable works:

Key Earth System Science challenge  Airborne particulate matter (PM) poses a  serious health risk for much of the Earth’s  population, and is a well-known cause of  heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular and  respiratory illness, low birth weight, and  lung cancer (Newby et al., 2015; Atkinson  et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2013; Loomis et  al., 2013; Brook et al., 2010). The 2013  Global Burden of Disease Study  (Forouzanfar et al., 2015) ranks ambient  PM as the top environmental risk factor  worldwide, responsible for nearly 3 million  premature deaths per year.   The National Research Council (NRC,  2004), European Commission (EC, 2004),  and World Health Organization (WHO, 2013) have stressed the importance of filling the gap in  understanding of the associations between specific particle types and health impacts.  Understanding the associations between specific particle types and health impacts is critical  because different types of particles originate from a variety of sources, and intervention  and emission control strategies need to be prioritized to maximize protection of human  health. Meeting this challenge requires implementing the vision put forth in the 2007 Earth  Science Decadal Survey, namely that “developing a reliable observational and predictive    Although there is a scientific consensus that  exposure to PM increases the risks of death  and disease, the relative toxicity of specific  PM types—components having different size  and chemical composition—is poorly  understood (Bell et al., 2007). According to the  US Environmental Protection Agency, “[T]he  evidence is not yet sufficient to allow  differentiation of those constituents or sources  that may be more closely related to specific  health outcomes” (EPA, 2013a). Moreover,  there is currently very little monitoring of PM  species outside of the US (Health Effects  Institute, 2010).   ;’      2   capacity, based on remote-sensing data used in the context of human health risk, should be a goal  of future space mission decisions and agency responsibilities” (NRC, 2007).    Anticipated scientific and societal benefits: Identifying the toxic constituents of PM has far- reaching implications for safeguarding public health and prioritizing intervention and control  strategies. Improved knowledge of particle type-health outcome relationships can also help  prioritize research on the biological mechanism for PM toxicity (NRC, 2004). The US Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) emphasizes that “the large estimated benefits of EPA rules are  mostly attributable to the reduction in public exposure to a single air pollutant: fine particulate  matter” (OMB, 2011). Because these controls are also associated with roughly half of all  regulatory costs (proposed at $66.8 billion in FY16), discriminating health outcomes by source- specific PM type and identifying the most toxic sources and components—as opposed to the  current assumption of equivalent toxicity—will help to identify vulnerable populations for  specific intervention strategies, and lead to more targeted regulations and significant cost  savings.   Science communities that would be involved: The scientific challenge requires an  interdisciplinary effort comprised of researchers and policy specialists with expertise in remote  sensing, aerosol science, atmospheric chemistry, air quality, computer science, epidemiology,  and public health, along with biologists responsible for studying the mechanisms of PM toxicity  to establish connections between the satellite-based retrievals and adverse health outcomes.  2. Why is it timely to address this challenge now?  According to the UN, world population is expected to grow by 33% from 2000 to 2030, with  major population increases in urban centers in less developed countries. The current projections  are that if business-as-usual is maintained, the rate of premature mortality due to PM could  exceed 6 million deaths per year by 2050, double the current amount (Lelieveld et al., 2015;  Jerrett, 2015; Apte et al., 2015). Evidence that health effects depend jointly on PM size and  composition was presented in some recent studies (Eeftens et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). The  significant health hazards and associated uncertainties as to which particle types and sources are  the most injurious makes it is imperative that Earth science assets be applied to improving our  understanding of their association with human health impacts, providing the necessary  information to enable targeting societal resources toward the most effective means of protecting  public health.   NASA investments during the last decade, primarily through the Earth Science Technology  Office’s Instrument Incubator Program, have brought polarimetric and lidar technologies  required for particle speciation monitoring to a high level of technological maturity. These  technologies are ready to be transitioned to space.  3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing this challenge?  Surface PM monitors alone cannot meet the challenge of understanding of the associations  between specific particle types and health impacts because they are too sparsely distributed,  expensive to install and maintain, and non-existent in many parts of the world where air pollution  health impacts are greatest. The distribution of monitors in even well instrumented areas requires  the assumption that everyone living within a 20–50 km radius experiences identical PM  exposure. In reality, aerosol concentrations vary over spatial scales smaller than the distances  between monitors, so such assumptions lead to inaccurate exposure estimates (Ross et al., 2013).      3   The US EPA’s surface PM2.5 network, which measures particles with aerodynamic diameter <2.5  µm, has an annual cost of over $60M (South Coast Air Quality Management District, 2013), and  given the cost per station, dense measurements at neighborhood scale (a few km) even for  limited geographic areas would be impractical and cost prohibitive. The EPA recommends urban  PM monitoring at this scale as it represents conditions where people commonly live and work  (EPA, 2013b). EPA PM2.5 speciation measurements are even more spatially and temporally  limited than the total PM2.5 network, with ~200 in the US, a few dozen in Europe, and virtually  none elsewhere. Existing deterministic chemical transport modeling (e.g., CMAQ) used by EPA  has limited capabilities due to biases in prediction of PM loadings and limited observational  constraints. Space-based observations offer the only practical and cost-effective approach to  measuring total and speciated PM concentrations with sufficient density and coverage to  determine PM composition variability at spatial-scales relevant for human health worldwide.   Existing and Planned US and International Programs: Currently, global estimates of PM2.5  are derived from a combination of aerosol data from NASA satellite instruments such as MISR,  MODIS, and CALIPSO (van Donkelaar et al., 2010; 2013; 2015), and the resulting products  have been used in a variety of health impact studies, including the Global Burden of Disease  Study (Brauer et al., 2012). However, these instruments, as well as VIIRS on Suomi/NPP and  CATS on the International Space Station, either do not contain all of the required capabilities  needed to partition PM into specific types, or do not provide sufficient spatial coverage or  resolution. Current and planned passive instruments that provide adequate coverage and partial  capabilities for particle speciation, such as OMI (ultraviolet), POLDER (polarimetry), and future  sensors based on these instruments (e.g., EVI-1 TEMPO and EUMETSAT’s 3MI) are unable to  address this challenge either because of their inability to provide sufficiently accurate aerosol  data or because their spatial resolution is too coarse.   Additional investments needed relative to existing and planned U.S. and international  programs: The capabilities required to meet the identified science challenge include: (a)  spatially-resolved aerosol absorption, particle size, and refractive index, (b) sub-kilometer  footprints to resolve the neighborhood scale, and (c) vertically-resolved aerosol microphysical  characterization to accurately constrain the transformation of the passively-determined column  integrated quantities to near-surface speciated PM. A combination of next-generation passive and  active polarimetric instruments provides this suite of capabilities. Passive multiangle radiometry  from the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared with high-accuracy  polarimetry at sub-km resolution will provide column integrated optical, microphysical, and  macrophysical aerosol properties, including abundance, particle size distribution, single  scattering albedo, real refractive index, and particle shape with wide areal coverage (Waquet et  al., 2009; Xu and Wang, 2015; Xu et al., 2015). Simultaneous retrievals using high spectral  resolution lidar measurements provide vertical profiles of aerosol backscatter and extinction and  layer-wise estimates of aerosol concentrations, effective radius, and complex index of refraction  (Müller et al., 2014) need to accurately constrain the transformation of the passively-determined  column integrated aerosol properties to near-surface speciated PM.   Linkage of space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data  for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs: Advanced satellite observational  capabilities are, by themselves, not sufficient to address the challenge of extending the scientific  understanding of the optical properties and chemical composition of aerosol species hazardous to  human health from localized to regional and, eventually, global scales. The linkages between      4   aerosol optical properties retrieved by remote sensing techniques and aerosol chemical  composition measured in situ must first be well established with an integrated satellite/surface- level data and modeling strategy (IWGEO, 2004). The approach requires four principal elements:  (1) A chemical transport model that provides initial estimates of the abundances of different  aerosol types for selected geographical areas where PM pollution is a significant air-quality issue  and where PM surface monitoring is limited. (2) Spaceborne instrumentation consisting of multi- angle, multispectral radiometric and polarimetric imaging in conjunction with high spectral  resolution lidar. (3) Geostatistical models derived using collocated surface PM monitors to  “calibrate” the satellite retrievals, thereby providing maps of near-surface concentrations of  major PM sources with dense sampling and wide coverage.  This element will benefit from  measurements of PM2.5 composition being implemented by the Surface PARTiculate mAtter  Network (SPARTAN) (Snider et al. 2015). (4) Geocoded birth, death, and hospital records and  epidemiological analyses that associate exposure to PM types from particular sources with health  outcomes.  The PM type-exposure statistics and health associations, made available to decision  makers worldwide, would be used then to prioritize intervention and emission control strategies.  In summary, the space-based observations would yield immense societal benefit by offering  unprecedented information on PM composition.          5   References  Atkinson RW, Carey IM, Kent AJ, van Staa TP, Anderson HR, Cook DG (2015).

The dominant source of uncertainty has been traced to model diversity in the   response of clouds to climate change.  Narrowing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity and improving   the confidence of climate projections represents one of the greatest challenges faced by the Earth   Science community, suggesting better constraints on the magnitude of cloud feedbacks are key.  In   organizing the Grand Challenge Initiative on Clouds, Circulation, and Climate Sensitivity (Bony et al.   2015), the WCRP has recognized the critical importance of advancing our understanding of cloud   feedbacks and the processes responsible for them.     While we have had little success in reducing the range of estimated climate sensitivity, we have greatly   improved our knowledge of the processes involved.  Fundamental mechanisms behind longwave   feedbacks due to deep tropical clouds are better understood (Hartmann and Larson, 2002), although   questions remain about the importance of mesoscale organizing processes (Wing and Emanuel, 2014;   Mauritsen and Stevens, 2015).  The dominant uncertainty in cloud feedback, however, is associated   with shallow marine clouds (Bony and Dufresne, 2005), which are highly sensitive to changes in their   environment.  A number of verifiable mechanisms underlying these feedbacks have recently been   proposed (Brient and Bony, 2013; Sherwood et al., 2014; Nuijens et al 2015) which require testing   against observations.     Accumulating evidence suggests the relevant shallow cloud processes are mediated more by   atmospheric circulations than by microphysical processes.  Both theoretical arguments and modeling   across scales suggest that many aspects of circulation – the depth of the marine boundary layer, the  moisture gradient between the sea surface and the free troposphere, the rate of subsidence, etc. – will  change in response to global warming.  It is these changes, many involving the redistribution of water   vapor in the vertical, that are expected to have by far the largest impact on shallow clouds in a future   climate.  The large diversity in predicted cloud feedbacks is due to the net feedback being the result of   a balance of processes which are poorly represented in global models.     Cloud radiative feedbacks are the result of changes in cloud amount, height, albedo, and thermo-  dynamic phase.  The predicted forced changes in these properties are small but radiatively significant   and the signatures will only emerge from the noise of natural variability on multi-decade timescales,   placing very stringent requirements on the long term accuracy and stability of the sensors used to detect   such change.  The most easily observed signatures of the cloud response are expected to appear as   changes in vertical structure rather than vertically-integrated quantities (Chepfer et al 2015).      Progress since the first Decadal Survey   CALIPSO and CloudSat entered the A-Train just before the release of the first Decadal Survey report.   We are now approaching a decade of cloud profiling from lidar and radar, co-located with radiance   measurements from CERES and MODIS.  It is hard to overstate the value of these observations in   refining our understanding (L'Ecuyer and Jiang, 2011).  Active profiling has provided, for example,   direct measurement of cloud vertical structure in place of ambiguous retrievals based on top-of-  atmosphere radiances (Mace and Wrenn, 2013; Di Michele, et al. 2013).  Comparisons of the vertical   distribution of shallow clouds observed by lidar with model predictions has shown that global models   poorly represent the influence of the large-scale environment on cloud structure (Nam et al. 2012).  Co-  location of active profiles with broadband fluxes from CERES has significantly reduced uncertainties   in the surface radiation budget and enabled calculation of atmospheric heating profiles (Haynes et al.   2013), revolutionizing our ability to understand the coupling of clouds and circulation.         Detection of the changes in cloud properties responsible for feedbacks, on the multi-decadal scales   required for climate change signals to emerge from the noise of natural variability, requires an   observing system with exceptional stability.  Lidar, via time-of-flight measurements of vertical cloud   structure, provides the most rigorous observation of cloud fraction and cloud height (thought to be the   cloud variables most responsible for shortwave and longwave cloud feedbacks, respectively).  Nadir-  viewing lidar has been shown to be capable of providing an accurate climate benchmark of 3D cloud   distribution, with sampling uncertainty below that of the natural variability of clouds at space-time   scales relevant to climate (global monthly and annual zonal mean, for example).  With addition of co-  located, well-calibrated passive sensors, cloud albedo and diabatic heating can also be constrained.      Why are space-based observations fundamental?   Clouds and radiation are highly variable in space and time and many of the most important feedbacks   occur over remote ocean regions.  Global, unbiased space-time sampling from satellite sensors is   required to provide the necessary constraints on global feedbacks.        Measurement needs vs. planned programs.   Active cloud profiling: We have reaped untold benefits from 35-plus years of observations from passive   satellite sensors.  A similar multi-decade record of combined active-passive observations will provide   additional benefits, but only if future missions are designed in a way which supports the construction of   consistent, long term unbiased data records as one of their objectives.  EarthCARE will launch in the   near term, but plans must be developed now for the post-EarthCARE era.  The Aerosol-Clouds-  Ecosystems (ACE) mission, identified by the first Decadal Survey report but still in pre-formulation   phase, includes advanced lidar and cloud radar instruments.  ACE is currently envisioned as a mission   focused on process studies rather than producing climate data records, however, and the core payload   does not include the sensors necessary to address the issues discussed above.     Water vapor: Shallow marine clouds are highly sensitive to the modulation of longwave cooling by   water vapor in the lower free troposphere, and to the detailed vertical distribution of water vapor in the   lowest 2 km of the atmosphere.  We are limited by the capabilities of current satellite retrievals in   testing hypotheses and constraining critical processes.  High spectral resolution measurements in the   thermal infrared and multi-channel microwave radiances from AIRS/AMSU represent the current state   of the art, but the broad radiative kernel functions are unable to resolve either the shallow marine   boundary layer or the gradients in water which are critical to shallow cloud processes.   No satellite missions are planned which could overcome these limitations.  Advanced radio occultation   constellations optimized for water vapor retrievals may help, but they inherently suffer from poor   horizontal resolution.  Water vapor DIAL lidar can in principle provide the vertically resolved profiles   necessary to characterize the vertical distribution of water vapor.  Although DIAL technology is not yet   sufficiently mature for satellite applications, a new generation of aircraft instruments is now coming on   line.  Appropriate technology developments in the near term would set the stage for a transition to   space in the near future.  There may also be a role for networks of ground-based instruments which   could be deployed in regions of particular interest or in regions not viewable from satellite, such as the   humidity field beneath opaque clouds.      Anticipated societal benefits   Reducing uncertainties in climate sensitivity will improve our abilities to predict climate change, which   would have a huge economic value (Cooke et al. 2013).  The resulting improved understanding of   cloud processes will also very likely have benefits for numerical weather prediction.  Advances in   understanding and increased confidence in climate predictions will improve our abilities to plan for and   mitigate the impacts of climate change, with tremendous societal benefits.

Clouds & Aerosols: A key challenge/question for Earth System Science in basic and  applied research  It is commonly accepted in the climate modeling community that studies of the anthropogenic  warming of the Earth with Global Climate Models (GCMs) depend heavily on parameterizations  of still poorly understood cloud-radiative feedbacks, which have the potential to dampen or en- hance changes in essential climatic variables. The complexity of these feedbacks defies easy rep- resentation in GCMs, ultimately translating into much uncertainty in our understanding and  questionable predictions of climatic change.  The situation worsens when interactions with natu- ral and anthropogenic aerosols are included.  Indeed, the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) persistently assigns “very low confidence” to aerosol, cloud and radiation inter- actions with even the sign of the resulting climate forcing remaining uncertain.   Given the extreme multi-scale nature of the aerosol-cloud-radiation system, spanning  synoptic- to micro-scales, it is not surprising that the aerosol-cloud-radiation enigma has dogged  the atmospheric sciences for over 30 years.  The system is indeed riddled with convoluted non- linearities. Examples include: turbulent fluid dynamics (convection, entrainment, mixing); sensi- tive thermodynamical thresholds controlling phase changes (nucleation, evaporation, freezing);  cloud-specific processes (condensational growth, particle coalescence, precipitation onset, aero- sol scavenging, and so on); and of course their impacts on the atmospheric radiative energy  budget and, from there, regional and global climates.     Among the challenges facing the community, the following interrelated trio stands out in  terms of acute need of improved physical understanding, vastly better representation in GCMs,  and crippling gaps in measurements:   1) intra-cloud variability and properties near cloud edges (both inward and outward directions   around sides, tops and bottoms);   2) turbulent entrainment, subsequent mixing processes, turbulence in clouds, and their interac-  tions with cloud microphysics;  3) the so-called aerosol “twilight” zone.  We need to address these challenges for all types of clouds, but especially for shallow (“puffy ”)  cumulus clouds where, in essence, we are entering the poorly understood non-adiabatic regime  and the aerosol-cloud continuum.  This framework is closer to reality and holds the key to future  model advancement.    Although these are small-scale phenomena, not usually considered to be accessible by  space-based remote sensing observational techniques, they necessarily have observable cloud- scale signatures if they indeed affect the climate system.  That means that they can be identified  and quantified by judiciously merging cloud process models and remote sensing “systems,”  which we define as  everything that has to happen before stakeholders get what they really want.   That would be geophysical properties, not just radiances or images.  Thus, a remote sensing sys- tem consists in one or more functional sensors along with an operational data-processing pipeline,  integrated as needed across sensors.   To translate the above challenges into remote sensing terminology, measurements and al- gorithms alike, we must “zoom-in” as much as possible onto the cloud-aerosol interface, i.e.,  cloud boundaries that are convoluted 3D entities.  Moreover, we need to look for optical and  microphysical structures inside clouds that will reveal previously invisible processes.  For starts,  this means that we must move past simple plane-parallel assumptions we currently make about  clouds and aerosols, and embrace the full three-dimensional (3D) nature of cloud-aerosol sys- tems.        3       2. Timeliness and readiness of addressing this challenge/question  To underscore the timeliness of acting on the cloud-aerosol-radiation-climate problem, which  (we restate) is the most uncertain element in the prediction of future climate, both global and  regional, we recall that the current El Niño event may be countering temporarily the global trend  toward a warmer climate.  In fact, we may again see marked increases in surface temperatures as  the El Niño subsides, akin to what happened in the 80s and 90s.   To address the challenge of forecasting climate change, we need to zoom out from small- scale processes unfolding at cloud boundaries to the geopolitical realm.  Simply put, we now ask  what can go wrong if, for lack of understanding clouds and aerosols, we are unable to forecast  future climate with enough skill to assess impacts on different regions?   We have all heard about the potentially dire consequences of climate change for sustain- ablity (hence the food supply), for air quality (hence public health), for water quality and quanti- ty (hence both food supply and public health), for sea-level rise, and so on.  In principle, this is  enough to justify resources, increased as needed, to address the cloud-aerosol-radiation-climate  problem that is holding back progress in future global and regional climate forecasting.   However, looking at an even broader context, we all know that there are climate-change  deniers, or a least “minimizers,” generously funded by energy sector and industrial interests, that  are proactive in the arcane world of environmental policy, with potentially far-fetching ramifica- tions into the funding of climate science research.  These groups are quick to emphasize our lack  of progress in our understanding of the climate system and in improving our forecasting skill.   The subtext here is that if climate is not really changing, for all we know, then the question about  anthropogenic forcing is moot.  More precisely, the climate system may have an inherent ability  to react (via feedback) to forcing, either natural or artificial, and thus remain stable.   It is also common wisdom that politically-related if not the same lobbying forces are gen- erally fierce defenders of defense spending and whatever foreign engagement that may mean to  sustain it.  Paradoxically, the US DoD and the US Intelligence Community (IC) at large, starting  with the White House, have decided that climate change is so real that has they have created ded- icated taskforces to assess its National Security implications in both likely and worse-case sce- narios; cf. https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/center-on-climate- change-and-national-security.html, http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/612710.   The threat is that environmental stresses, irrespective of whether they are caused by natural pro- cesses or human activity, have the potential to generate political failures, ineffective governance,  possibly violent unrest.  These developments may in turn cause population displacements that  will dwarf the already overwhelming and too-often tragic migrations what we are currently see- ing coming from the Middle East, Central Asia, Northern and Equatorial Africa, not to mention  Central and South America.  We clearly need to improve our science-based grasp on global and  regional climates, whether or not they are changing, whether or not human activity is a factor.    In view of its dominance of current uncertainty in climate forecasting, the cloud-aerosol- radiation-climate conundrum thus needs urgent attention.  Moreover, since current science and  technology are not effective in reducing uncertainty, this attention will require innovation from  several sectors.  Most notably, satellites cannot measure processes, only a limited set of out- comes.  Thus, there needs to be an unprecedented collusion between sensor data and modeling  systems.  A combination of modeling innovation and Moore’s law is enabling 3D Large-Eddy  Simulation (LES) models with grid-spacing <10 m for boundary layer domains up to ~10s of km  as a promising path forward.  By coupling LES models with observational field campaigns        4     (mostly in-situ aircraft), the cloud physics community is starting to make strides toward im- proved understanding of clouds; from there, we anticipate improved representations in GCMs.     We argue below that the remote sensing enterprise is not participating in this advance to  its fullest potential.  With the proper investments, it can however accelerate the necessary pro- gress in understanding clouds and their interactions with aerosols and, from there, their represen- tations in climate models.    3. Are space-based observations key to addressing this challenge/question?    a. Will existing and planned U.S. and international programs provide capabilities necessary to  make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions?   No.  Although EOS-era observations have not yet been fully exploited, current operational re- trieval methods have clearly outrun their utility.  Moreover, planned US and international (e.g.,  EarthCARE) missions will not bridge in the short term the identified gap since new capabilities  (e.g., polarization) come at the expense of others, mostly the desperately needed increase in spa- tial resolution.    If not, what additional investments are needed?  A whole new paradigm in full 3D cloud-aerosol retrieval is emerging in the specialized literature,  often taking inspiration from advances in medical imaging.  It capitalizes on increased computa- tional prowess (i.e., Moore’s law) combined with recent advances in inverse problem theory that  have lead to practical implementations of 3D spatial reconstructions (i.e., tomography).  In such  problems, there are very many unknowns and at least a few times more observations.  This is  clearly research that NASA can benefit from.  To this end, NASA will need to invest in the kind  of cross-disciplinary teams that can develop the necessary breakthrough.  There is also a related  need for higher spatial resolution that can be obtained via:  • RT-based solutions for broader (gas-contaminated) spectral channels, for better SNR;  • compressed sensing;  • overhead assets and engagement of the US IC (cf. http://dels.nas.edu/Study-In-  Progress/Improving-Understanding-Clouds/DELS-BASC-11-05?bname=basc).    b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for  addressing key scientific questions?  Suborbital (ground-based and airborne) observations can more readily attain the high spatial res- olution we need to perform 3D reconstructions of cloud-aerosol mixtures.  These data will also  provide both validation material for the new tomographic reconstruction algorithms, and a  unique access to the aerosols that affect key cloud microphysical processes unfolding at cloud  base.    c. Anticipated scientific and societal benefits?  Apart from above-mentioned support of National Security issues via improved climate modeling,  the IC will benefit from the new 3D atmospheric tomography capability since there is interest in  quantifying 3D aerosol/cloud properties in the IC.    d. What science communities would be involved?  Applied math, computer science, statistical physics.    ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"guillaume bal::yangang liu::"}

The PBL controls surface fluxes as well as the temperature range  and concentration of gases (water vapor, CO2, pollutants), aerosols, and chemical  constituents that humans and ecosystems experience.  In addition, the turbulence in the  PBL and its coupling with free-tropospheric conditions controls convective initiation,  cloud coverage as well as pattern and intensity of precipitation.  The PBL is thus a critical  layer in the atmosphere, but is still not optimally represented both in current weather and  climate models as well as in observations.    As a result, there is an established and growing need for PBL observations over land for  research in hydrology, ecology, land-atmosphere interaction, turbulence, cloud and  convection processes, turbulence (e.g. large eddy simulations (LES)), and  aerosol/chemistry studies as well as associated weather and climate model evaluation and  development (Workshop Report on Scientific Challenges and Opportunities in the NASA  Weather Focus Area, 2015). Modulated strongly by PBL structure, evolution, and  feedback processes (e.g. entrainment and atmospheric circulation at the meso- to macro- scale), an improved PBL representation will have profound impacts on society, surface  hydrology (namely soil moisture and runoff), its connection to clouds and precipitation,  and anthropogenic influences (e.g., CO2 and pollution gases), and extreme weather in a  changing climate.    1.1 Need for Space-based Observations  The last ten years have seen considerable attention and mission support dedicated to  individual components of Earth’s water and energy cycles as a result of the 2007 Decadal  Survey.  This includes land surface states and fluxes (e.g. soil moisture, snow, surface     temperature, groundwater, evapotranspiration) and atmospheric quantities and profile  information above the PBL (e.g. temperature, humidity, clouds, precipitation).  The PBL,  however, remains a major gap in our observational suite and is therefore currently the  limiting factor in observational process studies.  Ground-based remote sensing and in-situ  (i.e. radiosonde) measurements of the thermodynamic and kinematic structure and  evolution of the PBL will continue to be limited to short-term field campaigns and  spatially restricted networks for the foreseeable future.  Spaceborne instruments, on the  other hand, would afford the ability to monitor and improve understanding of these  processes on global and multi-year scales. Even so, there is very little attention or  planning (short or long-term) in place for improving lower tropospheric thermodynamic  sounding from space and, as a result, PBL research and observations have been identified  as a ‘terra incognita’ in current agency programmatic focal areas.     1.2 Timeliness   The impacts of the PBL on water and energy cycles are typically felt at sub-daily  timescales (e.g. 1-3 hourly) and at ~100m vertical and ~100m-10km spatial scales.  To  this end, the current suite of spaceborne instruments has seen only limited advances in  instrument technology and algorithms as they relate to PBL (height and structure)  retrieval.  Hyperspectral sounders such as AIRS and IASI are the most capable in terms  of spectral (and hence, vertical) resolution, but retrievals have not been tailored for the  PBL and are strongly limited by cloud cover and surface emissivity effects. Standard  lidar (e.g. CALIPSO) can obtain high vertical resolution of backscatter, but is limited in  return time and spatial sampling and does not provide thermodynamic state information.   Geostationary satellites (e.g. GOES) have the required temporal (i.e., 15-min to 1-hr)  coverage, but are limited by having only a few IR channels capable of resolving the PBL.   GPS-RO shows some promise for PBL retrieval, but is limited by irregular sampling,  multipath effects, and confounding issues related to humidity and topography, as well as  the inability to capture variations horizontally in the thermodynamic field.  Thus, while  each of these sensors have some lower tropospheric monitoring capabilities, there are  even more limitations that make them impractical for routine PBL observations.  It is  therefore timely to assess how available technologies, including CubeSats, can be  leveraged, combined, or evolved in order to form a dedicated mission or sub-mission to  routinely monitor the PBL on diurnal timescales.      2          Key Challenges and Science Questions  • How can we quantify and improve the process-level and diurnal cycle   representation of the water (including precipitation), carbon and energy cycles in  weather and climate models?   o PBL monitoring is required to address unresolved issues related such as  those to surface heterogeneity, entrainment, stable and transitional PBLs,  urban PBLs, aerosol, and land use change impacts.   o PBL is a regulator of the highly uncertain soil moisture-precipitation  feedback and the role of surface land cover gradients and change.   • When and where, globally, are the mechanisms that support hydrological and  climatic extremes (such as drought) amplified or suppressed by PBL processes  and feedbacks?     o Feedbacks of soil moisture on temperature and precipitation are PBL- dependent and are strongly connected with the evolution of extreme  events.   o The diurnal cycle of the PBL is dependent on climatic regime and surface  soil moisture and vegetation states.   • How can the PBL be used to integrate and improve estimation of other water,  energy, and carbon cycle components that are difficult to monitor from space (e.g.  surface fluxes (ET), winds speed, pollutants)?     3     Space-based Observations and Synergies with other Data  To fully retrieve the structure and evolution of the PBL, the community will need to  bridge the gap between current disparate attempts across missions (mentioned above) to  characterize the PBL over land and determine the challenges for improving retrieval of  PBL height and lower tropospheric thermodynamic profiles via next-generation satellite  technology.  This will require a) an evaluation of the current methods and products  related to PBL remote sensing from satellite, b) identification of the most likely  approaches that will meet weather/climate modeling, process-level understanding and  human health needs, and c) determination of the instrument and mission strategy that can  achieve these goals.    One potential approach is to synergistically use both space-borne (active and passive) and  ground-based remote sensing to simultaneously retrieve the thermodynamic structure of  the PBL.  The high vertical resolution and PBL height detection from active sensors  compliments the true thermodynamic sounding capability of passive sensors.  The  majority of the information content in ground-based spectral observations is in the PBL,  and using these observations will aid in the separation of the emission from the surface  vs. the lowest atmospheric levels from the space-borne point-of-view.  A small number of  ground-based spectrally resolved remote sensors are operational; these instruments can be  used to improve and evaluate methods to retrieve PBL structure at high temporal  resolution from satellite sensors, which can then be applied globally.  [These sites include  the ARM instruments at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) supersite (1 Raman lidar, 5  AERIs and Doppler lidars over a 100 km diameter region), at the North Slope of Alaska  (NSA) sites at Barrow and Oliktok Point, and at Graciosa Island in the Azores, and at the  Lindenberg, Cabauw, Payerne, and Chilbolton observatories in Western Europe.]   3.1   Calibration/Validation  Remote sensing studies of the PBL will require calibration and validation support, much  of which is already in place or being planned at extensive field campaigns using new  advances in ground-based remote sensing platforms.  One such example is the ARM-SGP  supersite that includes numerous ground-based profilers as well as routine radiosonde  launches, and a number of proposed L-A campaigns with new instrumentation focused on  diurnal PBL monitoring.  One significant challenge is to characterize the surface  contribution (in both temperature and emissivity) to the satellite observation, and to  develop methods to separate this contribution from the emission from the lower  troposphere.  A complete error analysis should be included so that uncertainties in the     quantification of the surface contribution can be propagated to provide uncertainties in  the retrieved boundary layer profiles.   3.2    Synthesis with Other Platforms   The PBL is a key integrator and transport layer that links the water, energy and carbon  cycles and pollutants (gas and particulates) at the L-A interface.  As a result, routine  observations will enable closure of the PBL budgets of heat, moisture, and CO2 and at the  same time enable coupling of current satellite-based retrievals of individual variables of  the L-A system, such as soil moisture (e.g. SMAP/SMOS), land cover states such as  vegetation properties and types (MODIS, Quicksat), evapotranspiration and surface  temperature (MODIS, Landsat), clouds and aerosols (CloudSat/CALIPSO), precipitation  (GPM), dust and smoke emissions (Terra/MISR), and free atmosphere thermodynamic  profiles (AIRS/IASI).   3.3    Synthesis with Models  PBL parameterizations used in weather, climate and Earth System models generally vary  widely in terms of complexity and physical assumptions (as evidenced by the large  number of PBL schemes available in the community WRF model).  Single-column  models (SCMs) have not evolved significantly in the last 15-20 years, while LES and  cloud resolving models (CRMs) are being more widely developed but still lack extensive  observations needed for validation across a range of conditions and representation of  spatial heterogeneity.  Overall, these modeling assets would benefit from the process  understanding gleaned from observations of PBL structure and evolution over a wide  range of climatic regimes, including those of feedback processes such as cloud-surface  radiative effects and entrainment.  For example, the GEWEX local land-atmosphere  coupling (‘LoCo’) community has developed a suite of diagnostics to quantify the  connection of soil moisture to precipitation in models and observations, most of which  require or would benefit from information on the structure (e.g. PBL height) and/or  composition of the PBL.   4     Anticipated Scientific and Societal Benefits  The need to understand the direct and indirect (feedback) effects of natural and  anthropogenic activities over land at meso- (e.g., mountain, low-level jet, sea breezes,  and monsoon), synoptic- (e.g., frontal systems) and global- (e.g., El Nino Southern  Oscillation) spatial scales and seasonal-to-decadal time scales is of critical relevance to  commerce (esp. food, energy, and transport) and public and environmental health.  The  PBL is the region in the atmosphere where the influence of local terrain and terrestrial  processes and anomalies on large-scale atmospheric processes is felt, and the majority of  atmospheric water vapor, heat, momentum and carbon are transported within the PBL.  Observational evidence shows that the structure of the PBL can either suppress or support  the following:  extreme weather phenomena including, heat waves, severe thunderstorms,  and tornadoes; dispersion of environmental (e.g., dust and smoke) and anthropogenic  (e.g., pollution) emissions, and prolonged wetness or drought.  As such, an improved  representation of the PBL is a prerequisite for next-generation model simulations of  clouds and precipitation as well as extreme events in weather forecast and climate  models.         The diurnal evolution of the PBL is also strongly modulated by adiabatic heating by  absorbing aerosols such as soot and black carbon, while the dispersion of aerosol into the  free atmosphere is governed by the timing and strength of PBL lifting.  This feedback is a  key factor in dictating air quality near the surface, which has a direct impact on human  health, particularly in developing regions.  Improved PBL representation will directly aid  in pollution and air quality forecasts, which will extend the benefit of this effort to human  health and well-being.  Thus, Earth system models and end-to-end user models  benefitting from these advances will enable improved information for decision makers,  hydrologists, and water management agencies. This will also have a positive impact in  disaster management for the benefits of society and economy.      5     Key Science Community Involvement  Identified research communities: atmospheric sciences, atmospheric chemistry, climate  sciences, environmental sciences, forestry, hydrometeorology, biology, physics,  renewable energy (wind and solar), water resources engineering, hydrology,  environmental health, geospatial information sciences.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Inland sources of fresh water are critical for life on our planet. Even though 50% of the world's  population lives within 3 km of inland rivers and lakes, over 1.1 billion people currently do not  have access to clean water (WHO, 2006). Water crises are the greatest risk facing the world  today according to the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2015). Over 80% of the world’s  population currently faces high level water risk (Vorosmarty et al., 2010). Half of the world’s  500 major rivers and half the world’s lakes are classified as seriously degraded or over-depleted  (UNEP, 2006). The decline in the quality of water resources is causing the extinction of  freshwater species and a severe loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the most pressing question for  inland water ecosystems that can be addressed with remote sensing is “how is freshwater  quality and quantity changing in response to increasing stress from population growth and  climate change?” Specifically, the following ecosystem stressors and societal challenges can be  addressed with remote sensing capability:    1) Eutrophication, Harmful Algal Blooms and Water Clarity   Eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources can lead to  excessive algal growth and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Factors including nitrogen,  temperature, and possibly conductivity all contribute to this excessive growth (Paerl et al.,  2014; Rigosi et al. 2014) resulting in low oxygen, loss of biodiversity, loss of fisheries, decreased  light penetration causing the loss of submergent vegetation, and aesthetic and odor issues that  impact drinking water, commerce and tourism.  Though known to be widespread across all  continents, the extent and intensity of these blooms is uncertain.  Hence, we pose two key  research questions:    What are the trophic states of global inland waters and how are they changing?      Where are toxic algal blooms occurring, and what is the frequency of occurrence?      2) Watershed Alterations and Impacts   Inland waters are strongly influenced by land use, which can affect the timing and location of   inflows and water quality. Changes in runoff, particularly due to urbanization and associated   impervious surfaces, can increase flash flooding, extend periods of low flows, and alter channel   morphology. The increased intensity of the runoff events can increase erosional power and   entrain more soil particulate with greater particle size. The resulting water quality impacts   include greater siltation in receiving waters negatively impacting fisheries and benthic   organisms. Silt-laden water supply intakes incur greater cost to process and clean. Nutrients,   metals, and organic pollutants are also transported in association with the particulates. It is   therefore necessary to know and address:    How do inland waters respond to changes in their watersheds?       What is the rate of siltation in our waterways and reservoirs and what are the biological  consequences?     What role do particulates play in the transport and deposition of nutrients, metals and  organic pollutants in the aquatic ecosystem?       3) Climate Change Impacts   Aquatic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Changes to the hydrologic  cycle such as storm magnitude and frequency, extreme events, ratio of snow/rain, and water  stress all affect inland waters. Variations in meteorological conditions cause changes in water  temperature, evaporation, lake level, ice cover, hydrobiogeochemical regimes, and entire lake  ecosystems. Of particular concern are the impacts of changes in water temperature, which may  result in changes in species composition, abundance, and productivity. Temperature changes  impact lake area (through evaporation), stratification, thermal structure and subsequent  fisheries habitat, water chemistry such as CaCO3 and O2 solubility, mercury methylation rates,  carbon cycling such as CO2 flux out of the surface water, and bioaccumulation in sediments. It is  therefore important to address:    How will future climate change impact the quantity and quality of inland waters?     What role do inland waters play in the global carbon cycle and how is that changing?     How do thermal budgets of lakes vary in response to climate change and what are the  resulting biogeochemical responses?      4) Biodiversity and Invasive Species  Aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to species shifts caused by changes in their physical and  biogeochemical characteristics. These shifts can result in the loss of native species and  introduction of invasive species. Invasive species can harm native ecosystems and the  commercial, agricultural, or recreational activities that depend on them. The costs to control  and eradicate invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $120 billion annually  (Pimentel, 2005). Remote sensing has been utilized to document impacts from invasive species,  including Great Lakes water clarity due to invasive dreissenids (Limburg et al., 2010), distinguish  between native and non-native aquatic plant species (Santos, 2012), and support bioenergetic  modeling for invasive species (Anderson et al., 2015). It is therefore urgent and important to  know:    How have invasive species altered inland water bodies and what are the long-term  consequences?     What are the future invasive species and biodiversity threats for inland waters?    2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?  We are experiencing an unprecedented, rapidly changing environment, where inland water  quantity and quality are being impacted. We have very limited long-term data, and for only a  few of the 117 million lakes in the world. Many global lakes are in places where regular in-situ  sampling is not possible (remote high latitude lakes or large lakes in East Africa, for example). In  addition, our management and modeling approaches are ready for a stronger spatial     component and we need these data to validate models and to improve our understanding of  how aquatic systems develop spatially (e.g. algal blooms) so we can develop more effective  management strategies.   Presently a few satellite sensors can provide limited information on water quality, such  as water temperature, transparency, loading of suspended sediments, phytoplankton (bloom)  index, distribution of submerged vegetation, etc. In particular, the newly launched Landsat-8  with the added blue band provides new capabilities to observe phytoplankton in medium-size  lakes (>100 x 100 m2) and the planned PACE sensor will have hyperspectral capability, which  could provide the ability to improve discrimination of colored dissolved organic matter, non- algal particles and provide more detailed information on phytoplankton community in the large  lakes (> 1000 x 1000 m2).  Further, geostationary capability planned through GEO-CAPE will  significantly improve the resolution of time varying processes. Although there are still  uncertainties in the derived products from satellite measurements and some of these can be  quite large, the advancement of sensor technologies and retrieving algorithms should lead to  substantial improvements in the quality of these data products in the coming decades.    In addition, there are various airborne missions underway or planned for the  observation and monitoring of lake waters, with general measurements of hyperspectral  sensors, which would also significantly improve our capabilities in monitoring lake waters from  a remote platform. All these advancements will result in unprecedented data sources to  achieve improved management of inland water bodies.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   Proper water management relies on accurate information on water quality conditions. Given  the global extent of these critical water issues and the inability of traditional approaches to  address our informational needs, space-borne Earth Observations approaches are a promising  way forward. This is in particularly true and demanding for the many lakes that are in remote  locations where regular in-situ sampling is not possible. Space-based observations are unique in  that they can provide synoptic observations of multiple lakes across different continents, and  therefore provide a more accurate understanding of the response of different lake ecosystems  under the changing climate.  In addition, traditional monitoring frameworks are becoming  increasingly expensive at the same time agency budgets are declining and water quality issues  become more numerous and pervasive. Though many areas of the world face similar water  quality issues, they are viewed as inherently local and do not receive national or international  attention. Critical space-based observations needed are temperature and color at high spatial-  (better than 100m) and temporal -resolutions (at least every 4 days). The color measurements  should have high spectral resolution (5nm sampling from 0.4-1.0 um).  These will help  innumerable local water monitoring and management efforts, while also furthering our  scientific knowledge of how these critical ecosystems function.

Schaeffer and Darryl J. Keith      This is one of three responses formally provided by the EPA to the National Research Council in   response to the Request for Information concerning the 2017-2027 NRC Decadal Survey in Earth   Science and Applications from Space.       Question 1   Good water quality is necessary to support drinking water supplies, aquatic life, as well as   recreation in and on the water. It is important to have scientific understanding of environmental processes   to inform water quality management decisions to protect biological, physical, and chemical water quality   characteristics.  We highlight the need to consider inland water bodies, defined as lakes and reservoirs,   and estuaries as a new and important aspect of Earth System Science (ESS). Traditionally, inland water   and estuary sciences are categorized under ocean or land science.  However, there is increased demand   from state, federal, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for the ability to monitor water quality   by re-purposing ocean color and land imaging satellites. Therefore, we recommend an emphasis be placed   on water quality for inland and estuarine waters.  The next decade of ESS should be equally weighted with   inland and estuary water quality applied research, applications and operations.  Global consistency and   continuity of future satellite missions is required because of the spatial, spectral, and temporal disconnect   between sensors. The key science challenge that can be addressed is the ability to link anthropogenic   stressors to their environmental responses.  ESS can help detect and quantify harmful algal blooms   (Lunetta et al., 2015), invasive species (GLRI, GLWQA, 2014), water clarity in optically shallow waters   (Barnes et al., 2013), estuarine acidification (EPA, 2015a), effluent detection, pathogen indicators (EPA,   2012a), and climate temperature changes (EPA, 2015b).  ESS also complements monitoring and   assessments (Schaeffer, 2015; Keith et al., 2014), such as oil spill thickness and extent (ICCOPR, 2015),   fate and transport of nutrients and co-pollutants (Schaeffer et al. 2012; Schaeffer et al, 2013a), and benthic   habitat monitoring (Barnes et al. 2014),   ESS can  also assist in developing quantitative water quality   expectations that can lead to pollution reduction (EPA, 2012b).  Robust models are necessary for   management, but current models cannot resolve events because of limitations on knowing when and where   these events occur. Operationally, a challenge is improving the capacity of current and future missions to   routinely provide quality measurements that support federal and state agencies tasked with water quality   management. ESS provides information on dynamic and ephemeral events over extensive spatial and   temporal scales.       Section a   There are future missions planned that may address some current sensor limitations such as GEO-  CAPE and Sentinel-3, and with continued repurposing of satellites such as Sentinel-2A, 2B; and Landsat   8/9.  Additional investments are needed for Landsat-10 and beyond, which include spectral wavebands   and signal-to-noise ratios required for deriving water quality.  PACE and GEO-CAPE should include the                     highest spatial resolution possible to resolve the maximum number of water bodies and spatial gradients   when imaging within the continental US.   The PACE science definition team suggested resolutions at   250-500m for lakes and estuaries (PACE SDT, 2012).  However, as of the 2015 IOCS Meeting, PACE   may only provide 1km resolution globally, which reduces applicability for inland waters. Recent studies   suggest 100-200m ground sample distance requirements are needed to resolve spatial gradients (Tzortziou   et al., 2011).  Spatial resolution still remains a major hurdle for inland waters, where sensors with a 300m   pixel resolution provide data for <4% of US lakes and reservoirs.  Conversely, Landsat resolution (30m)   may resolve 30% of these waters.       Future ocean color and land missions should no longer be categorized as just land or ocean   missions, but integrated equally with inland and estuary water quality research and applications.       Question 2    Ocean color satellites have been equipped with sensors optimized for collecting data over the   global ocean (McClain, 2009), but not over inland or estuarine waters.  Due to the coarse spatial resolution,   water quality science and applications also depend on terrestrial sensors, such as Landsat (Mouw et al.,   2015).  Progress has been demonstrated in deriving data from inland and estuarine waters using MODIS,   MERIS, HICO, and Landsat. All of these sensors have provided access to inland and estuarine waters   (Keith, 2014; Keith et al., 2014).  Landsat 8 may be useful due to its radiometric resolution and calibration   accuracy (Vanhellemont and Ruddick, 2014; Franz et al., 2015). We expect that with Sentinel 2A and the   forthcoming Sentinel 2B, temporal resolutions will improve, approaching those associated with ocean   color missions (Hestir et al., 2015; Mouw et al., 2015). In-water algorithms, atmospheric corrections, and   land adjacency effects will require mature approaches over the coming decade.  Calibration and validation   exercises are typically not inclusive of inland and estuarine waters, but should be integrated into future   missions (Palmer et al., 2015). The next decade is an opportune time to begin addressing technology   modifications required for these water systems such as sensor sensitivity, dynamic range, and appropriate   spatial, temporal and spectral resolution (Mouw et al., 2015). The lack of current and planned missions   focused on the scales of variability encountered within inland and estuarine waters suggests new missions   should be planned to meet these new requirements. Overall, greater spectral and spatial resolution with   frequent resampling is required for applications and operations.   State, federal, and NGOs have begun to actively request available satellite data to address scientific   questions and applications with regard to water quality management.  Recent advances in cloud-based   infrastructure allows for coordinated data sharing with centralized, open access, publically available data   (Mouw et al., 2015).  Water quality managers have, and continue, to overcome barriers (Schaeffer et al.,   2013b) in adopting new methods that leverage satellite data.  For example, EPA recently accepted the use   of ESS derived water quality products in developing numeric nutrient criteria (Schaeffer et al, 2012;   Schaeffer et al, 2013a).       Section b    Space-based observations are one of the many tools available to state, federal, and NGO entities   for addressing water quality questions.  Satellites provide information and answers to questions at   improved spatial and temporal scales. In situ monitoring along with evolving sensor technologies can   provide insights at resolutions that complement ESS. Discrete sampling and moorings do not provide   complete spatial and temporal coverage and have limited ability to quantify the full range in variability   that can impact human health and the environment.  However, discrete samples and moored instruments   can fill ESS gaps during periods of cloud cover, or in areas not currently resolvable, and provide validation   data.  Citizen science is emerging as a data source into the next decade.  Crowd sourced internet tools such                         as interactive maps (Meier, 2012) can be used to identify locations of concern within communities that   weren’t possible a few years ago. ESS can address or inform communities on water quality changes that  impact societal uses.  Technologies, such as open source Arduino microcontrollers, will allow for   development of low costs sensors (Leeuw et al., 2013) that can be combined and integrated with ESS to   derive now-cast and forecast models at watershed scales.  Mobile technology allows complex satellite   data files to be simplified and made accessible to communities for informational outreach.  ESS data   products will also assist with targeted deployment of existing federal, state, tribal, and municipal   monitoring and research efforts (Mattas-Curry et al, 2015). Mobile technology also show promise for   citizen science such as Citclops, HydroColor, Secchi, and EPA Cyanoscope apps.      Question 3   Feasibility of incorporating ESS into water quality monitoring has been demonstrated and   operational applications are expanding. Many state, federal, and NGO entities conduct field-based   activities with limited resources to provide information.  ESS is a potential solution to overcome limited   geographic extent and temporal coverage. When coupled with field-based observations, ESS data provide   a more comprehensive understanding and establish the capability to monitor, assess and forecast changes   in ecological condition.  Information is needed to assess baseline conditions and to understand trends for   management.   Inland and estuarine waters present a challenge because of the complex hydrologic   connections and spatial separation, variable ecological drivers, and anthropogenic stressors.  ESS allows   for an integrated and system level approach that may will be beneficial as extreme events increase (IPCC,   2012).      Section c    Water quality is connected to economic success, human health, social well-being, and drinking   water security. Citizens are familiar with weather reports for daily decisions.  ESS for water quality could   provide information, achieving similar levels of familiarity in the coming decade, influencing decisions   on where to take vacations, purchase homes, or best times for fishing, diving, or swimming.  Finally state,   federal, NGOs, tribes, and local municipalities will be better informed for protecting water supplies and   the public.        Section d    Inland and estuary water quality science could facilitate integration (NRC, 2014) of freshwater,   ocean, atmospheric, and land sciences to solve problems in order to protect humans and the environment.    Participation by ocean color, landscape and aquatic ecology, public health, economics, computational and   hydrologic modeling science communities is anticipated. Government agencies, such as CDC, NIEHS,   USACE and EPA, can integrate application sciences with research from NASA, USGS, and NOAA.    Benefits would extend to state agencies, health and environmental departments, non-profits such as World   Resources Institute and Nature Conservancy, in addition to the World Bank, World Health Organization,   and United Nations.

This is one of three responses formally provided by the EPA to the National Research Council in   response to the Request For Information concerning the 2017-2027 NRC Decadal Survey in Earth    Science and Applications from Space.      This paper addresses United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) operational and research   challenges for the next decade in the utilization of space-based observations for the assessment of   terrestrial properties affecting land, water, and air resources, and human health. Effectively assessing   and mitigating exposures requires techniques for rapid measurement of a stressor on diverse geographic,   temporal, and biologic scales and an enhanced infrastructure for rapid deployment of resources to   address imminent threats. In concert with EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment,  satellite remote sensing offers a tool to identify and quantify relevant exposures that may pose a threat to   ecosystems and/or human health. National efforts to reduce environmental risk require the best available   scientific information, optimally linking in situ measurements with space-based remotely sensed data to   investigate exposures at various spatial and temporal scales.      EPA has relied heavily on a variety of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)   missions to assess land cover change on both spatial and temporal dimensions. For example:       MODIS Terra and Aqua normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data has   been used to track land cover change in the Great Lakes Region, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin   Islands, and the Albemarle-Pamlico Basin in order to identify drivers of lake and river   eutrophication and coral reef degradation. This time-series research identified cropping practice   changes within the Great Lakes region which corresponded to changes in legislation allowing   increases in biofuel production for the year 2007 (Shao et. al, 2010).        EPA is investigating the full characterization of atmospheric deposition exposure from NOX,   SOX, and O3 in order to address total deposition budgets of these pollutants. Improved gaseous   and particulate flux estimates affecting these pollutants are critically needed to reduce   uncertainty in setting and implementing effective secondary ambient standards. Leaf area,   assessed both in situ and remotely from space-based sensors (MODIS and Landsat), is a critical   input in modeling aerosol flux within forest canopies. These are a few examples of recent     research and regional applications using space-borne observations to address key issues affecting   both water and air quality.    1  United States Environmental Protection Agency, Landscape Characterization Branch/Office of   Research and Development, Research Triangle Park, NC                                                                             2  United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response,   Washington, DC          The following questions were generated from specific projects and tasks embedded within the 2016-  2021 research plan within the Office of Research and Development and from US EPA Regional remote   sensing applications. This subset of research and application areas is intended to give a sense of the   scope and domain of EPA concerns which require a combination of in situ and space-borne remotely   sensed data.      - Which mechanisms (i.e., land use changes, best management practices, and proximal   anthropogenic stressors) negatively affect or improve watershed condition?      - What linkages can be made between riparian buffer quality and water quality attributes (i.e., base   flow, sediment, nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen)?      - How is pesticide drift affected by the proximity of agricultural fields, landscape and   meteorological features?      - What geospatial characteristics of upland stressors contribute to the formation of harmful algal   blooms and contribute to coral reef degradation?    - How is surface water nutrient enrichment linked to mountaintop mining, the construction of  valley fills, or the extraction of oil and gas resources?      - How have climate change, draining (direct and through groundwater abstraction), and  development altered the fabric of the landscape in decreasing both the abundance of depressional   wetlands and the timing, depth, and duration of inundation?       - How does watershed integrity, resilience, and recovery potential in landscapes with high  densities of “geographically isolated” wetlands affect geomorphology, water quality, and  biological integrity?      - Can watershed resiliency and recovery potential be compared over spatial and temporal scales  using land cover, hydrodynamic and human demographic change analyses?      - How does size, spatial patterning, and wetting/drying cycles of depressional wetlands affect their  presence and function as resilient nodes on the landscape?      - Can in situ and remotely sensed data quantify wetland landscape connectivity?     - Are there associations between measured air and lake temperature across a range of lake  morphologies?      - Can multispectral imagery identify sources of high nutrient loading into streams and rivers from  agricultural fields?      - Can space-borne observational systems detect mine tailings in historic mining sites along the  Sierra Nevada region (California and Nevada)?      - Can airborne and ground hyperspectral imaging combined with in situ sampling provide a cost  effective approach in the identification of trace metals released from the Carson River Mercury   Site in western Nevada?       - Can space-borne/airborne observational systems assist in the assessment of dam integrity and  tailing pile stability at high priority sites nationwide?      - Can high-resolution imagery combined with seasonal data acquisitions provide information on  abandoned tanks within the Yakima tribal lands in western Washington?         Answering these questions requires a continuity of the imagery types and data products produced by the   current NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) missions (Landsat 8, Sentinal-2a and Sentinal-3   (ESA), MODIS Terra and Aqua, GRACE, EO-1, VIIRS). These requirements will partially be met with   the launch of the planned missions (GRACE-FO, GEDI, HyspIRI, ICESat-2, LIST, NI-SAR). The   greatest challenges in addressing these EPA centric issues are having access to remotely sensed data   types that are (1) at the appropriate resolution: spatial, temporal, radiometric, and spectral, (2) not cost   prohibitive, and (3) accessible and easily digestible to end users in common file formats and databases.         The continuity and data suite provided by the MODIS sensor has driven many applications in   environmental research. We have successfully classified land cover using temporal profiles at a 250 x   250 m resolution in a number of differing climatic regions within the United States and its Territories.   The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched in 2011 with the intent to extend   measurements initiated by MODIS. However, spatial resolution has decreased from 250 m to 375 m,   thereby compromising the identification of land cover types that previously were resolved at the finer   resolution of the MODIS sensor. Also, the number of data products previously produced by the NASA   Science Team, are no longer available with this new mission. Leaf area index (LAI) is one product   casualty missing in the VIIRS suite of data products. This omission will prevent this input from   replacing static LAI values currently utilized by regional and continental air and climate models. The   Hyperion sensor aboard the EO-1 platform has provided value added data useful for answering many of   the questions addressed above, especially in the identification of mine tailings and other trace metals   located in arid environments. The planned hyperspectral missions, both Germany’s Enmap followed by  NASA’s HyspIRI, will allow for better coverage of areas of interest and timely data acquisition. The US  EPA has also used LIDAR and RADAR data operationally and for research to identify areas of mining   and to quantify forest structure and above-ground carbon.        The Landsat program has provided a rich legacy of data over the past 30-plus years for terrestrial remote   sensing. The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) has utilized this data to derive   the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and all the associated data products, a collection of data that   has driven land use/land cover change modeling, a critical component of the US EPA EnviroAtlas   (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/). Having two Landsat satellites in orbit simultaneously would   reduce revisit time in half, increasing the probability of cloud free data capture.      In contrast to the above medium-to-coarse spatial resolution data types, many EPA applications require   high spatial resolution imagery to characterize and monitor both environmental condition (e.g., trees,   streams, riparian and road vegetation buffers ) and anthropogenic nutrient and contaminate sources (e.g.,   impervious surfaces, industrial infrastructure, pipes). Imagery requirements for resolving objects within   the built environment include sub-meter to five meter pixel size multi-spectral, multi-temporal visible-  infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) imagery. High resolution LiDAR and photogrammetric-derived   point clouds and derivatives are also needed to accurately represent the three dimensional landscape.   These data types have been utilized as ancillary data for machine learning algorithms to produce more   accurate high resolution urban land cover maps embedded within the EPA EnviroAtlas (Pickard et al.,   2015). Locational identification of these terrestrial natural and anthropogenic stressor sources using   remotely sensed methods can inform issues in chemical safety, air and water pollution, sustainability,   and urban heat island effects.      In addition to high resolution data access are the need for (1) supporting algorithm development to assist   with classification, feature extraction, and QA editing, (2) the development of robust spectral libraries,   and (3) the cyber-infrastructure for citizen science and crowd sourcing. EPA also seeks guidance from   NASA and other federal agencies on long term scientific data management: best practices and standards   for maintaining public access to data and products.      In this paper we have presented key challenges facing the EPA operational and research community   with respect to terrestrial observations. These remote sensing challenges are pertinent to the current   research planning effort within the EPA and operationally as the Agency responds to environmental   impacts across the states and regions. Space-based observations in coordination with in situ   measurements have proven invaluable with respect to assessing land cover change, vegetation dynamics   and structure, etc. over the past 30 years and will continue to be a primary asset well into the next   decade.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the   spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in   the coming decade?      Atmospheric water vapor plays both a radiative and chemical role. An increase in   stratospheric water vapor will radiatively cool the lower stratosphere and affect the   frequency of occurrence of polar stratospheric clouds, thereby impacting stratospheric   ozone chemistry. Enhanced levels of stratospheric water vapor strengthen ozone loss in the   presence of ozone depleting substances (ODSs). Hence, a climate with increased   stratospheric water vapor will have a delayed ozone recovery even while ODSs are reduced.   Changes in stratospheric water vapor also can be a significant radiative forcing for surface   climate. A ~10% drop in stratospheric water vapor levels near the tropopause at the end of   2000 has been estimated to have contributed a radiative forcing of −0.1 W/m2; this may  have slowed the amount of warming from CO2 increases over the 2000-2009 period by   25%. Decadal variations of stratospheric water vapor concentrations also likely contributed   to an enhanced rate of surface warming in the 1990s.   Stratosphere water vapor is important because the amount of water vapor   determines important aspects of the planetary radiative energy balance through the strong   cooling to space from water vapor. This contributes to determining the temperature of the   stratosphere, which then affects the dynamical circulation of the upper atmosphere and can   affect stratospheric chemistry through temperature dependent reaction rates. Moreover,   water vapor provides the source of the hydroxyl radical, OH, which takes part in several   stratospheric chemical processes.  An understanding of how the distribution of water vapor   is controlled, and of how this distribution might change in future, is therefore important for   understanding certain aspects of climate change.   The 2014 NASA Science Mission Directorate workshop on Outstanding Questions   in Atmospheric Composition identified future trends of stratospheric water vapor as a key   priority for stratospheric composition research over the next few decades.   At that   workshop, it was also emphasized that trend detection for stratospheric species requires   observations of profiles of these species continue with at least current spatial and temporal   resolutions.  To address both the chemical and radiative role of stratospheric water vapor     to changes in climate, long term global data records are critically needed.  Space-based   observations are ideal for monitoring stratospheric water vapor as much of the interfering   tropospheric water vapor signal resides in the lower troposphere.  Complementary ground   based and aircraft based measurements are also required for targeted process studies that   are on the scale of the processes doing the dehydration.  Therefore, both coarse global   measurements and fine scale measurements are needed.     The key mechanisms that contribute to control of stratospheric water vapor   concentrations are stratospheric photochemistry and transport, tropical tropopause   dehydration and polar dehydration. Additionally, transport from the troposphere to   stratosphere at mid latitudes also appears to impact stratospheric water vapor.  Because we   don’t fully understand control of stratospheric water, it is difficult to assess how it will  change with increasing greenhouse gases.  There have been trends noted in past   measurements, in particular stratospheric water vapor has been noted to have increased   since 1980, but the reason for that increase is not understood.  In particular, we don’t know  what is natural variability and what is forced.  Although overshoots of ice into the   stratosphere have been observed, we don’t know how much they contribute to the overall  stratospheric budget.  There has been much work looking at impacts of the summer time   Asian anticyclone circulation on stratospheric water vapor, but those impacts have not been   quantified.  Other measurements related to processes, such as temperature, aerosols, and   cloud parameters, as well as measurements that can help deduce relevant processes, such   as those related to stratospheric transport, are also needed.      To summarize, the key questions to address are:       1) How will stratospheric water vapor and its associated radiative forcing change with  increasing greenhouse gases?   2) What is the driving mechanism behind past observed changes in stratospheric water  vapor?   3) What is the contribution of overshooting cloud ice to the stratospheric water  budget?   4) How does the summertime Asian anticyclone circulation contribute to the  stratospheric water vapor budget?   5) What are the key microphysical processes controlling the input of water to the  stratosphere?     2.   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect   to readiness?       Passive infrared and microwave sensors such as the Atmospheric Infrared Radiance   Sounder (AIRS), Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), Microwave Limb   Sounder (MLS), and the Advanced Microwave Sensor Unit (AMSU) have provided a   unique opportunity to sample global water vapor distributions in the UTLS.  Passive   infrared measurements of water vapor typically have a vertical resolution of 1-2 km and   their relative error range in the 15-25%, resulting from radiances contaminated by aerosols   and clouds.  Microwave profilers can provide humidity measurements in regions of non-  precipitating clouds, however, they can suffer from underlying biases resulting from     uncertainties in the microwave surface emissivity of land. When the current fleet of   stratospheric chemistry satellites exceeds their useful lifetime, we will no longer have   vertically resolved stratospheric water vapor measurements. Therefore, we need to plan   now for a new space based platform for more accurate measurements of stratospheric water   vapor profiles.  Current space based passive remote sensing platforms provide relatively   coarse vertical resolution profiles of water vapor measurements in the upper troposphere   and stratosphere.  Furthermore, the continuity of the data record is jeopardized as the   current suite of measurements are aging and no follow on missions are currently planned.     High accuracy water vapor profile measurements in the upper troposphere and   stratosphere are critical for climate research and are essential to form an absolute standard   between existing measurements; changing humidity of only a few percent in the upper   troposphere and lower stratosphere can influence the upwelling long-wave radiation by an   amount similar in magnitude to that caused by doubling of carbon dioxide.  Space based   water vapor lidars are ideal for high accuracy measurements of water vapor throughout the   troposphere and lower stratosphere as they are self-calibrating and not prone to bias   resulting from aerosol and cloud contamination.  Furthermore, they can retrieve water   vapor profiles during day and night, at all latitudes, and during all seasons.  There is also a   need for highly accurate ground and airborne based remote and in situ measurements of   upper tropospheric and stratospheric water vapor profiles for satellite validation and to use   as a transfer standard to combine satellite data sets if there is a gap in global measurements.   Additionally, the ground based and airborne lidars and aircraft and balloon based in situ   measurements will be vital for process-based studies looking at detailed microphysical   processes associated with water vapor and its transport into the stratosphere. What is   critical is that we make continued measurements of highly accurate, vertically resolved,   water vapor in the upper troposphere and stratosphere.      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?      A space based water vapor lidar mission concept study was carried out by DLR (Gerard   et al., 2004) to assess the performance of a space based water vapor differential absorption   lidar (DIAL) in relation to passive measurements such as IASI.  The results of the study   indicated that for a fixed error threshold, a water vapor DIAL would extend the water vapor   measurement to a greater altitude than for IASI and would have approximately twice the   vertical resolution.  The study also indicated that the water vapor measurements would   extend from the lower stratosphere down to the surface which would have significant   positive impacts in determining the background error covariance used in national weather   prediction (NWP) analysis, as well as for providing a stable absolute reference for   calibrating other passive sensors.       Advances in laser and lidar technologies leveraged from successful space based lidar   missions such as CALIPSO have enabled a new class of airborne water vapor DIALs that   serve as prototypes for future satellite missions.  NASA and DLR have been flying airborne   water vapor DIALs for targeted process studies for over two decades, however, recent   advances have made the prospect for a space based DIAL more feasible.  NASA is   currently developing an airborne DIAL to fly on high altitude platforms for profile   measurements of water vapor and aerosols and clouds from the surface to the UTLS.  This     development will serve as the prototype for future space based water vapor DIAL missions.    NASA has also been making continuous ground based lidar measurements of water vapor   profiles in the upper troposphere and stratosphere in support of the network for the   detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC).  The use of airborne and ground   based water vapor lidars in addition to highly accurate in situ sensors for targeted process   studies are critical to advancing our knowledge of the impact of water vapor in the upper   troposphere and stratosphere to long term changes in our climate.  Airborne process studies   will also pave the way for the next generation space based water vapor DIAL measurements   required to overcome existing measurement deficiencies and lack of measurement   continuity.  The implementation of a space based DIAL targeting profile measurements of   water vapor will provide distinct advantages with respect to current observational   capabilities.  Amongst these are:    High accuracy, low bias, and high vertical resolution profiles extending from the  surface to the lower stratosphere.    Low sensitivity to bias resulting from lack of a priori knowledge of surface  emissivity and temperature profiles, other interfering molecules, and contamination   from aerosols and clouds.    Capability to resolve above cloud tops as well as through and below low optical  depth clouds as well as in between broken clouds.    Increased vertical extent and resolution.     Simultaneous information on aerosol distributions and optical depths from the  surface to the lower stratosphere, boundary layer height, cloud top height,   distribution, and phase, and surface reflectance and canopy height.        4. Impacted Science Communities     Water vapor is the most dominant greenhouse gas and plays a vital role in both the   climate and weather communities.  Water vapor profile measurements with improved   accuracy and vertical resolution would benefit many major research programs including   the World Climate Research Programs (WCRP), the Stratosphere-troposphere Processes   and their Role in Climate (SPARC) program, the Network for the Detection of  Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), and the Global Energy and Water Cycle   Experiment (GEWEX) program.  In addition to providing stratospheric profiles, the DIAL   approach can provide simultaneous high accuracy and high vertical resolution water vapor   profiles in the lower troposphere that are needed for numerical weather prediction   initializations for improving predictions of severe weather and convective initiation and   aggregation spanning from local to global scales.

Climate change and air pollution are arguably the most significant environmental problems facing the   United States and the world over the next decade.  There is an urgent need to dramatically curtail   emissions of greenhouse gases, including powerful short-lived forcers such as methane, to help mitigate   the severest impacts of climate change.  Globally, indoor and outdoor air pollution are now recognized   as leading contributors to the global burden of disease, accounting for as many as 7 million deaths   annually.a  In the United States, new health research has led to a decision to tighten the National   Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone.b  Attaining the new standard by 2025 across the United States,   excluding California, is expected to cost $1.4 B/yr and yield up to $5.9 B/yr in quantifiable health   benefits.  In California, it is expected to take additional time to meet the NAAQS, leading to $0.8 B/yr in   additional costs but yielding up to $2.1 B/yr in additional quantifiable health benefits.c  As the standard   is lowered, international and non-anthropogenic influences are becoming more significant relative   contributors to NAAQS non-attainment.  Simultaneously, these extra-regional influences are changing   in absolute magnitude due to global development and climate change.     To develop appropriate policies, the EPA needs to understand how emissions of air pollutants (including   greenhouse gases) in the United States and abroad are changing over time and how these emissions   affect air quality and climate through atmospheric chemical, radiative, and dynamic processes occurring   over global to local scales. Networks of ground-based air quality monitors and bottom-up emissions   inventories based on limited source measurements and emission factor estimates are not adequate to   provide the information needed to understand important sources of emissions or the most important   atmospheric processes occurring aloft.  Space-based observations can and do play important roles in   informing both emissions estimation and atmospheric process understanding, ultimately contributing to   better air quality management and climate change mitigation policies.   The concept of an integrated observing strategy (based on surface, airborne and space observations of   atmospheric composition) was articulated in 2004 by the intergovernmental group Integrated Global   Observing Strategy (IGOS) in their Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations (IGACO)                                                     a  Lim, S.S., et al.

Page 2 of 4      report.d  The EPA has increasingly recognized the need to integrate space-based observations into our   research and operational work, and views space-based observations as a critical component to an   integrated observation system.  With respect to air quality, the use of space-based observations was   highlighted in 2013 by the National Science and Technology Council,e which recognized such   observations will be required to address the challenges we face within the United States and across the   globe.  The NSTC’s findings complement the findings and recommendations of other NRC reports,  including the first “decadal survey.”f  For space-based observations the nexus between atmospheric and  carbon cycle science presents an immense transdisciplinary challenge best addressed through an   integrated observation approach.   Current and planned satellite capabilities, including the planned geostationary deployment of the   TEMPO instrument, provide some very valuable observations that will help address air quality   management challenges within the United States.g  In a constellation with geostationary satellites from   Europe and Korea, TEMPO will also contribute to an improved understanding of the international and   global flows of air pollution and their impact on climate.  However, our ability to address the scientific   and policy challenges of the next decade are limited by two important gaps in the Earth System Science:    1) space-based observations of some key pollutants and 2) a robust operational infrastructure to integrate   surface, space, and in-situ observations, global and regional-scale atmospheric models, and emissions   inventories for purposes of evaluation and assimilation.    Missing from the expected suite of satellite observations that will be available to atmospheric scientists   and air quality managers in the next decade are high temporal and spatial resolution measurements of   methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO).  CH4 is a potent greenhouse gas whose control targets   different sources and influences climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide-abatement   measures.h Many CH4 sources are diffuse and difficult to measure at the point of emission, leading to   significant uncertainty in current emissions estimates.  CH4 also contributes to the growing global   background concentration of tropospheric ozone (O3), influencing surface O3.  CO has been shown to be   a very useful indicator of long-range transport of air pollutants from fires and anthropogenic sources.i                                                      d Barrie, L.A., et al.

Page 3 of 4      CO is also an O3 precursor and CO from wildfires may increase with climate warming, posing   challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards.      The technical capability to observe CH4 and CO is well developed.  Surface networks and airborne field   campaigns provide very high quality data; however such data are sparse in space and time.  The sparse   data lead to a lack of confidence in the available CH4 emissions inventories j that remains a problematic   limitation to the design of efficient environmental policies.  In contrast, geostationary space-based   observations of CH4 and CO can provide high quality data everywhere in North America continuously   for years.k  The measurement techniques have been proven in space, with well documented algorithms   and effective validation programs to allow for an understanding of uncertainty.  NASA has conducted   studies of suitable observations which could address these measurement needs, most directly through the   mission concept studies for the 2007 Decadal Survey mission GEO-CAPE.l  No current or planned   observing capability meets these defined EPA needs for CH4.  The Canadian MOPITT instrument on   NASA’s Terra platform measures CO near the surface and aloft using multi-spectral techniques that  provide otherwise unavailable data to reveal vertical and horizontal air pollutant transport.  However,   MOPITT is in extended operations and no follow-on is presently authorized.   CH4 observations with sensitivity near the surface from geostationary orbit could enable CH4 emissions   estimates that are consistently measured, timely, transparent, complete (over greater North America),   accurate, and spatially attributed.  CO observations at high temporal and spatial resolution could enable   better diagnosis of long range transport of pollution from anthropogenic sources and wildfires.  These   observations would be valuable from both scientific and management perspectives, leading to greater   understanding of key environmental processes and creating a foundation for better policies with multiple   societal benefits.     The value of these observations, and other satellite-based observations, would be significantly enhanced   by the development of a more robust infrastructure to support the integration of different types of   observations (surface networks, satellites, ground-based remote sensing, sondes, aircraft, etc.), models,                                                     j Miller, S.M. et al.

Leading researchers have demonstrated techniques for integrating multiple types of   observations, for linking global and regional scale models, for evaluating emissions estimates based on   observations, and for improving model estimates by assimilating observations.  However, we do not   have the institutional, information, and technical infrastructure to perform these operations efficiently or   make these capabilities available to the broader scientific community or the air quality planning and   climate policy development communities on an operational basis.  Creating such an infrastructure within   the United States to exploit the full value of observations and enable an improved research-to-  applications paradigm would require a sustained and coordinated multi-agency, multi-government effort,   such as that demonstrated by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicem, a large pan-European   effort.  A similar effort across United States could significantly enhance the Earth System Science   enterprise and the societal benefit achieved by future investments in satellite observations.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  Inland sources of fresh water are critical for life on our planet. Even though 50% of the world's  population lives within 3 km of inland rivers and lakes, over 1.1 billion people currently do not  have access to clean water (WHO, 2006). Water crises are the greatest risk facing the world  today according to the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2015). Over 80% of the world’s  population currently faces high level water risk (Vorosmarty et al., 2010). Half of the world’s  500 major rivers and half the world’s lakes are classified as seriously degraded or over-depleted  (UNEP, 2006). The decline in the quality of water resources is causing the extinction of  freshwater species and a severe loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the most pressing question for  inland water ecosystems that can be addressed with remote sensing is “how is freshwater  quality and quantity changing in response to increasing stress from population growth and  climate change?” Specifically, the following ecosystem stressors and societal challenges can be  addressed with remote sensing capability:    1) Eutrophication, Harmful Algal Blooms and Water Clarity   Eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources can lead to  excessive algal growth and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Factors including nitrogen,  temperature, and possibly conductivity all contribute to this excessive growth (Paerl et al.,  2014; Rigosi et al. 2014) resulting in low oxygen, loss of biodiversity, loss of fisheries, decreased  light penetration causing the loss of submergent vegetation, and aesthetic and odor issues that  impact drinking water, commerce and tourism.  Though known to be widespread across all  continents, the extent and intensity of these blooms is uncertain.  Hence, we pose two key  research questions:    What are the trophic states of global inland waters and how are they changing?      Where are toxic algal blooms occurring, and what is the frequency of occurrence?      2) Watershed Alterations and Impacts   Inland waters are strongly influenced by land use, which can affect the timing and location of   inflows and water quality. Changes in runoff, particularly due to urbanization and associated   impervious surfaces, can increase flash flooding, extend periods of low flows, and alter channel   morphology. The increased intensity of the runoff events can increase erosional power and   entrain more soil particulate with greater particle size. The resulting water quality impacts   include greater siltation in receiving waters negatively impacting fisheries and benthic   organisms. Silt-laden water supply intakes incur greater cost to process and clean. Nutrients,   metals, and organic pollutants are also transported in association with the particulates. It is   therefore necessary to know and address:    How do inland waters respond to changes in their watersheds?       What is the rate of siltation in our waterways and reservoirs and what are the biological  consequences?     What role do particulates play in the transport and deposition of nutrients, metals and  organic pollutants in the aquatic ecosystem?       3) Climate Change Impacts   Aquatic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Changes to the hydrologic  cycle such as storm magnitude and frequency, extreme events, ratio of snow/rain, and water  stress all affect inland waters. Variations in meteorological conditions cause changes in water  temperature, evaporation, lake level, ice cover, hydrobiogeochemical regimes, and entire lake  ecosystems. Of particular concern are the impacts of changes in water temperature, which may  result in changes in species composition, abundance, and productivity. Temperature changes  impact lake area (through evaporation), stratification, thermal structure and subsequent  fisheries habitat, water chemistry such as CaCO3 and O2 solubility, mercury methylation rates,  carbon cycling such as CO2 flux out of the surface water, and bioaccumulation in sediments. It is  therefore important to address:    How will future climate change impact the quantity and quality of inland waters?     What role do inland waters play in the global carbon cycle and how is that changing?     How do thermal budgets of lakes vary in response to climate change and what are the  resulting biogeochemical responses?      4) Biodiversity and Invasive Species  Aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to species shifts caused by changes in their physical and  biogeochemical characteristics. These shifts can result in the loss of native species and  introduction of invasive species. Invasive species can harm native ecosystems and the  commercial, agricultural, or recreational activities that depend on them. The costs to control  and eradicate invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $120 billion annually  (Pimentel, 2005). Remote sensing has been utilized to document impacts from invasive species,  including Great Lakes water clarity due to invasive dreissenids (Limburg et al., 2010), distinguish  between native and non-native aquatic plant species (Santos, 2012), and support bioenergetic  modeling for invasive species (Anderson et al., 2015). It is therefore urgent and important to  know:    How have invasive species altered inland water bodies and what are the long-term  consequences?     What are the future invasive species and biodiversity threats for inland waters?    2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?  We are experiencing an unprecedented, rapidly changing environment, where inland water  quantity and quality are being impacted. We have very limited long-term data, and for only a  few of the 117 million lakes in the world. Many global lakes are in places where regular in-situ  sampling is not possible (remote high latitude lakes or large lakes in East Africa, for example). In  addition, our management and modeling approaches are ready for a stronger spatial     component and we need these data to validate models and to improve our understanding of  how aquatic systems develop spatially (e.g. algal blooms) so we can develop more effective  management strategies.   Presently a few satellite sensors can provide limited information on water quality, such  as water temperature, transparency, loading of suspended sediments, phytoplankton (bloom)  index, distribution of submerged vegetation, etc. In particular, the newly launched Landsat-8  with the added blue band provides new capabilities to observe phytoplankton in medium-size  lakes (>100 x 100 m2) and the planned PACE sensor will have hyperspectral capability, which  could provide the ability to improve discrimination of colored dissolved organic matter, non- algal particles and provide more detailed information on phytoplankton community in the large  lakes (> 1000 x 1000 m2).  Further, geostationary capability planned through GEO-CAPE will  significantly improve the resolution of time varying processes. Although there are still  uncertainties in the derived products from satellite measurements and some of these can be  quite large, the advancement of sensor technologies and retrieving algorithms should lead to  substantial improvements in the quality of these data products in the coming decades.    In addition, there are various airborne missions underway or planned for the  observation and monitoring of lake waters, with general measurements of hyperspectral  sensors, which would also significantly improve our capabilities in monitoring lake waters from  a remote platform. All these advancements will result in unprecedented data sources to  achieve improved management of inland water bodies.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   Proper water management relies on accurate information on water quality conditions. Given  the global extent of these critical water issues and the inability of traditional approaches to  address our informational needs, space-borne Earth Observations approaches are a promising  way forward. This is in particularly true and demanding for the many lakes that are in remote  locations where regular in-situ sampling is not possible. Space-based observations are unique in  that they can provide synoptic observations of multiple lakes across different continents, and  therefore provide a more accurate understanding of the response of different lake ecosystems  under the changing climate.  In addition, traditional monitoring frameworks are becoming  increasingly expensive at the same time agency budgets are declining and water quality issues  become more numerous and pervasive. Though many areas of the world face similar water  quality issues, they are viewed as inherently local and do not receive national or international  attention. Critical space-based observations needed are temperature and color at high spatial-  (better than 100m) and temporal -resolutions (at least every 4 days). The color measurements  should have high spectral resolution (5nm sampling from 0.4-1.0 um).  These will help  innumerable local water monitoring and management efforts, while also furthering our  scientific knowledge of how these critical ecosystems function.

Privette and Edward J. Kearns   Center for Weather and Climate  NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information        Introduction   As part of its mission, NOAA provides objective data and tools to help the nation monitor, characterize, and  predict changes in Earth’s environment.  In support of this goal, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental  Information (NCEI) initiated a program in 2009 to develop and sustain satellite Climate Data Records (CDRs).   The National Research Council (NRC, 2004) defines a CDR as “a time series of measurements of sufficient  length, consistency, and continuity to determine climate variability and change.”   Most NCEI CDRs are derived  from data collected by operational meteorological satellites maintained by NOAA and the Department of  Defense.  CDR production typically requires the reprocessing of multi-satellite time series of raw observations  using baselined “climate quality” calibration and retrieval algorithms.  It also includes the regular extension of  records through processing of new observations forward in time.  As described below, NCEI recently expanded  the Program’s mission to encompass Reference Environmental Data Records (Reference EDRs).  Reference  EDRs are also reprocessed, high quality, long-term records, but which address societal benefit areas beyond  climate.  Compared to low-latency weather and hazard satellite products, Reference EDRs provide longer, more  consistent and seamless records with well-characterized uncertainties.  Currently, NCEI sustains 30 packages of  Reference EDRs and their associated collateral variables.  It maintains a similar number in development or in  transition to operations. Based on lessons learned, this White Paper describes Reference EDR production and  use, and the resulting considerations for observing and data system design.   The Reference EDR User Community   NCEI initially focused on fundamental (calibrated base observations) and geophysical CDRs per the  recommendations of the former Climate Change Science Program (2006; now the U.S. Global Change Research  Program) and others.  NCEI particularly pursued CDRs that could help address  outstanding questions identified  in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4; 2007).  The resulting  suite of records has contributed to key climate discoveries, sustained climate monitoring, seminal assessments  (e.g., National Climate Assessment, 2014), and increasingly underpins key climate modeling activities via the  Ops4MIPS program (Teixeira et al., 2014), among others.   Importantly, however, the private sector and others are now leveraging these records for uses beyond climate  research.  The uses typically involve putting current weather and climate events into historical perspective such  that businesses can anticipate likely market or environmental outcomes.  In recent years, for example,  agricultural interests have been better able to predict impacts of the Midwestern and California-based  droughts using CDRs of vegetation health, precipitation and snow cover (Karl et al., 2012).  Similarly, water  managers are assessing likely outcomes of the current El Nino based on precipitation patterns during analog     periods found in CDRs.  In some cases, the private sector is leveraging CDRs to improve near-term profitability,  gain competitive advantage or grow market share.  For example, by merging historic climate and business  records, some are predicting near-term consumer patterns based on recent past weather and climate events  (Schreck et al, 2015).  In other cases, businesses are providing value-added products and services based on  CDRs.   The extent and growth of these alternative applications led NCEI to transition the CDR Program into the  Reference EDR Program, where a Reference EDR is defined as “a time series of scientifically-based  measurements of the Earth’s environment with sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to provide  stakeholders and decision-makers with timely, relevant and reliable information.”  This terminology is  consistent with NOAA’s use of Environmental Data Record (EDR) to describe its operational satellite products,  and the use of “reference” to describe authoritative data sets (e.g., the U.S. Climate Reference Network).   Accordingly, NCEI now manages the Reference EDR portfolio, inclusive of CDRs, based on needs of a broader  set of stakeholders.  Although many needs still emanate from the climate community, they are now  complemented by those from geographic region interests, economic sectors, and other non-research  communities.     Lessons Learned and Recommendations   Using guidelines from experts groups (e.g., WMO, 2003; NRC, 2004, 2005), NCEI has distilled eight non- functional requirements for Reference EDRs, specifically that they be: accessible, extensible, preserved,  reproducible, sustainable, transparent, and continuously improved.  The following outlines recommendations  for mission and program design that would facilitate meeting these requirements effectively and affordably.   Issues for Observations   1. Observatory Continuity   The reprocessing of single mission data sets to correct for instrument, spacecraft or orbital degradation has  become common, and results have grown increasingly accurate.  However, multi-mission Reference EDRs  introduce an additional reprocessing challenge since mission upgrades within an observation family (e.g.,  thermal sounding) typically impart data discontinuities.  The discontinuities arise for many reasons, from  changes in instrument design and sampling approach to orbital changes which effectively alter the time of  observation.  The problem is particularly acute for records derived from satellites from different agencies and  countries (e.g., the global geostationary constellation).  Regardless, discontinuities typically require extensive  effort to ameliorate, and may impact downstream products and applications even after significant correction.   For this reason, Reference EDR development is most straightforward and affordable when the source data  come from the same or similar instrument and mission designs.  Obviously, this consistency must be balanced  by the advantages offered by occasional design improvements.  We encourage the Decadal Survey team to  consider the competing merits of continuity vs. upgrades in instrument design, and the efficiencies afforded by  greater international coordination in this area, in their recommendations.     2. Calibration and Validation   Accurate instrument calibration is clearly important since calibration errors can mask or alias important  environmental signals.  For multi-mission products, however, it can be especially significant since cross- instrument calibration can effectively pass calibration errors across observatories covering long time periods.   Clearly, missions should therefore archive and provide access to all prelaunch instrument test and calibration  information as well as post-launch calibration and time-varying instrument configuration information and  updates.  However, to facilitate detailed retrospective analyses, missions should consider a more  comprehensive set of practices and activities as suggested below.   Besides using internal instrument systems, adequate satellite calibration and validation programs include the  capture, archive and ease-of-access to ancillary data collected from lunar and other stable targets, near- simultaneous observations with other remote sensing observatories, and field networks and campaigns. In the  latter cases, despite the improvement in vicarious calibration sources – including in the growth and  maintenance of field networks for land, ocean, ice and atmosphere – most field sites were designed primarily  for purposes other than satellite validation.  Where these sites are less amenable to straightforward spatial  scaling, the mismatch in field and satellite instrument resolutions can add significant uncertainty to  comparisons.  This problem can be mitigated in some cases for satellite instruments that can be commanded to  provide higher resolution or better quality data than afforded through normal operations.  When this is  possible, it should be employed episodically through the mission lifetimes to enable sustained “climate quality”  calibration and validation.   It is important to highlight the critical need for overlap periods between successive missions to support  instrument co-calibration – the tuning of one instrument to match the observations of another.  A full year of  overlapping data is generally recommended.  The risk of missing sufficient overlap periods is obviously reduced  when successive satellites are procured, launched and stored on-orbit well before the need dates.  Note that  Reference EDR developers often use overlap data to “calibrate backwards” in time, i.e., adjust the predecessor  instrument observations to match those of the successor instrument with better calibration systems.  The  effectiveness of this approach means that new missions should continue to invest in and implement improved  internal instrument calibration technologies.   3. Information Conventions, Standards and Access   Efficient mission and program data management can significantly reduce the costs of re-analysis and  reprocessing activities.  For example, all observations, products, metadata, calibration and validation data and  associated information for a mission can be made accessible through a common information portal.  Where  field or other independent measurements and information are associated with specific mission data subsets,  they can be stored together or linked virtually to facilitate discoverability and access.  In all cases, the use of  common data conventions, standards and formats can significantly reduce reprocessing or data integration  costs.  NCEI, for example, has adopted use of the NetCDF4 format, ISO19114-2 compliant metadata, with  Climate and Forecast naming conventions to simplify processing, archiving and distribution.  Note that, in some  cases, access to key data or information is limited by proprietary, trade or intellectual property issues.  We  encourage the Decadal Survey team to consider opportunities that would simplify and improve access to and     use of disparate data types and sources.  Opportunities are clearly greatest when there is national and  international cooperation in this area.   Issues for Data Processing and Integration   1. Interim Records   Although teasing out faint climate change trends in data can require extensive post-observation instrument  analysis to minimize product uncertainties, other Reference EDR applications – particularly in the private sector  – put product timeliness at a premium.  These users are often willing to trade some accuracy for lower latency,  yet still insist on the overall consistency afforded by Reference EDRs.  The once-common practice of initially  reprocessing data years after observation to maximize instrument knowledge and hence product accuracy does  not meet their needs.  This has led to “Interim” Reference EDRs, which are early estimates of Reference EDR  values generated using the same climate-quality retrieval algorithms but lacking complete calibration or  ancillary information (see Bates et al., 2015, and reports of the Sustained, Co-Ordinated Processing of  Environmental Satellite Data for Climate Monitoring (SCOPE-CM) initiative).   At NCEI, Interim EDRs are often  used to forward extend Reference EDRs until all auxiliary data or other information is available, at which time  they are replaced with reprocessed Reference EDRs.  We encourage the Decadal Survey team to consider the  unique user needs of timeliness and long-term stability for this user community.   2.  Data Integration and Harmonization   To meet various user needs, NCEI is increasingly seeking to merge or harmonize satellite observations with  legacy or contemporaneous other measurements, including those from in situ instruments, radar and other  remote sensing sources, human-observers and proxy records (e.g., paleoclimate).  Integrating satellite and  meteorological station data, for example, can provide spatially and temporally continuous estimates of key  variables such as surface air temperature (1.5- to 2 m height), which currently is not accurately retrieved from  remote sensing alone.  Merging data types can also extend record lengths from decades to centuries and put  recent environmental changes in a richer historical context, enable better interpolation between satellite  observations, and anchor remote observations to highly accurate field observations during processing (e.g.,  Reynolds et al., 2007).   Because different observation approaches typically have different sampling  characteristics – often measuring somewhat different environmental variables (e.g., sea surface skin vs. bulk  temperatures), the integration and harmonization of these measurements is challenging.  We encourage the  Decadal Survey team to consider mission data system designs that would facilitate greater integration of space  measurements with other observation types.  Doing so may markedly reduce the cost, complexity and  uncertainty in integrated products.   3. From Research to Operational Production   Algorithm development continues to be a long, labor-intensive process, centered on the principal investigators  and their expertise in the science of Reference EDRs. To enable the continued production of their products into  the future, NCEI has engaged in a series of transition activities from the developer to move the algorithms,  documentation, and workflows necessary for Reference EDR production to an operational environment. In  doing so, NCEI has approached the transition and operations issues related to the code through a variety of     methods, including code wrapping, rejuventation, and re-writing. While all methods aspire to provide  continued, institutionalized production at a reduced integral cost, rejuvenation and re-writing of original  scientific code bases have proven to be, in NCEI’s experience, very costly and a barrier to efficient  institutionalized production. A priori adoption of community or NCEI code standards at the development stage  is the least costly path to independently maintainable operational code and algorithms, and support for these  code standards and practices by the community would pay dividends in the operational community. These  same standards and practices also facilitate information preservation in the archive.   4.  Improving Use   There is a major underlying dependency of the sustainment and use of Reference EDRs on the “back end” data  systems, including software, networks, algorithm libraries, and archive facilities that are often overlooked  during the planning of individual observing systems.  The growth of standards and tools that underlie machine- to-machine access and other modern technologies has reduced infrastructure costs and data latency for many  user communities.  However, other users communities – particularly non-experts in IT and/or satellite data –  remained challenged in discovering, accessing and using satellite products compared to other environmental  products (e.g., meteorological station data).  This stems in part from product volumes – which for Reference  EDRs are typically measured in terabytes -- as well as the relative complexity of form and format in which these  data are available.  For example, some products are available only in swath-format granules or through basic  access approaches (e.g., ftp, http).  Although access and distribution issues are generally the domain of data  centers, they are influenced or facilitated by satellite program goals and requirements.  Readily achievable  near-term improvements include improving server-side tools to analyze, map, subset, format and/or download  data by user-specified attributes.  The government’s provision of end-use code through modern collaborative  code repositories (e.g. GitHub) that provide examples of data access, filtering, and visualization may allow  more rapid and efficient utilization of Reference EDRs by the wider data application community that are  seeking to use them, particularly for broader uses outside of the geosciences,  including for socioeconomic and  public health applications. Users would further benefit if agencies or their industrial partners were to provide a  common multi-agency discovery and access point, and tag data stores with advanced metadata schema and  geohashes to enable web crawlers, to simplify and facilitate their data searches.   Sustaining NOAA’s Reference EDRs   NCEI now sustains 30 satellite Reference EDR packages, with additional packages transitioning to operations in  coming years (see Table 1.). These support NCEI’s goal to provide fundamental records (calibrated radiances  and other sensor records) and geophysical records relevant to NCEI stakeholder communities (e.g., water,  energy, agriculture, and climate).  Most were competitively selected based primarily on scientific merit and  have undergone extensive external review.  Others were selected primarily to meet emerging user  requirements subject to internal NOAA review.  NCEI actively manages its product portfolio in an open and  transparent manner to help ensure continuing community involvement and relevance. However, even though  these Reference EDRs are largely core or foundational, their sustainment depends on the continuing availability  of resources and capabilities (including support of space and non-space observatory assets).  We therefore  encourage the Decadal Survey team to identify capabilities to support these or related Reference EDRs for the  next decade.     Summary   Reprocessing and sustaining consistent and relevant multi-mission satellite records introduces new challenges  and requirements on satellite programs and missions.  To our knowledge, there were no operational U.S.  government programs providing CDRs or Reference EDRs at the time of the last Earth Sciences Decadal Survey.   Since that time, however, NOAA has instituted this capability, expanded and further diversified its user  community, and learned many lessons as described above.  As the value of Reference EDRs is increasingly  realized by different user communities, we believe NOAA’s and similar programs will continue and likely  expand across the agencies, and are therefore highly appropriate for informing the Decadal Survey process.

Nair   Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder and NOAA  National Centers for Environmental Information   White paper submitted in response to the Initial Request for Information for the 2017-2027 Decadal  Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space   Summary: Over the past fifteen years, thanks to three very successful European satellite missions,  geomagnetic field modeling has made tremendous progress but also become heavily reliant on space- based observations. Using high-precision data from the Low Earth Orbit Ørsted, CHAMP and Swarm  missions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed enhanced  operational models addressing the ever-increasing needs of accuracy sensitive users in government and  industry. The same data have also brought new insights into the geodynamo and the various sources of  the Earth’s magnetic field, prompting new research questions for geomagnetism and Earth System  science. However, the current Swarm mission is likely to end in 2021, putting at risk the performance of  future models supporting NOAA, Department of Defense, and Federal Aviation Administration operations  and further progress in geomagnetic research. Neither ground-based magnetic measurements nor  magnetic data from non-dedicated satellite missions can provide a viable alternative to Swarm-like data.  We argue for the need to launch a new constellation of magnetic satellites that would build upon the  knowledge acquired from Swarm, ensure the continuous support of enhanced navigation, resource  exploration and directional drilling by research and operational models and further our understanding of  geomagnetic sources.   1) What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   Geomagnetic field models are mathematical representations of the Earth’s magnetic field inferred from  ground and space-based observations. They are widely used for investigating the spatial and temporal  characteristics of the geomagnetic field and its sources, but also in an operational context, for orienting  a satellite, positioning a submarine or navigating a drill bit. Over the past  fifteen years, enormous  progress has been made in the field of geomagnetic modeling thanks to a stream of high-precision, Low  Earth Orbit (LEO) magnetic satellite missions launched by Denmark (Ørsted, 1999-2013), Germany  (CHAMP, 2000-2009) and the European Space Agency (Swarm, since 2013). Data-based models of  increasing spatial and temporal resolutions have been developed, furthering the use of operational  models by government and industry and opening up new scientific questions.    A key operational challenge: developing and improving NOAA’s operational geomagnetic models   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Centers for Environmental  Information (NCEI) have the responsibility of developing operational geomagnetic models for     2     government and industry. These models support enhanced navigation, resource exploration and  directional drilling. Three models are currently being produced by NOAA:    The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is a low-resolution model (up to degree 12 of the spherical  harmonic expansion), produced at 5-year intervals (Chulliat et al., 2015). It is used extensively by  the Department of Defense (DoD) in a wide range of positioning and navigation system  applications, including all aircraft, ships, submarines, and GPS units within DoD and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The WMM is also widely used by the International  Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NOAA, and in a  very large number of hand-held devices, including over one billion smartphones. It is a joint  product of the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United  Kingdom’s Defence Geographic Centre (DGC), and is jointly developed by NCEI and the British  Geological Survey (BGS). The current WMM has been downloaded over 16000 times since its  release in December 2014 and the WMM online calculators receive about 10 million hits/yr.    The Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM) is a higher resolution model, resolving anomalies down  to 56 km wavelength and addressing the needs of accuracy-sensitive users such as the DoD and  the resource exploration industry. The latest EMM was released in May 2015 and has already  been downloaded over 900 times.    The High Definition Geomagnetic Model (HDGM) is a global, high-resolution model coming with  software tailored to the needs of the directional drilling industry and is updated every year. It is  used by over 20 companies worldwide.   Magnetic models need to be regularly updated, due to the slow but unpredictable secular variation of  the core field. Moreover, there is a constant demand from government and industry for higher accuracy  and higher resolution. Addressing such needs will require further development of integrated models of  the crustal magnetic field, combining marine trackline data, aeromagnetic survey data and satellite data.  In addition to the improved spatial resolution, more sophisticated models, including models updated in  real-time, are needed to describe the rapidly varying magnetic fields generated by electric currents in  the ionosphere and magnetosphere. As will be explained in section 3 below, this cannot be done  without the continuous availability of high-precision, space-based geomagnetic observations in the  coming decade.   New research questions   Despite progress in observations and numerical simulations over the past decade, understanding how  the geodynamo works remains one of the biggest questions in Earth science. For example, we are still  unable to predict how long the current decay of the dipole field will last, or when the next geomagnetic  reversal will occur. These questions are intimately linked to our understanding of the outer core  structure and dynamics and of the Earth energy budget as a whole. They also have practical  implications, as the geomagnetic field is shielding the Earth from charged particles coming from the Sun  and the outer space. Recent advances in geomagnetic modeling have led to new questions regarding the  geodynamo but also the other sources of the Earth’s magnetic field.     3     a. Understanding short-term fluctuations in the geodynamo. Over the past decade, space-based  magnetic measurements have made it possible to model not only the core field and its secular  variation, but also the rapid fluctuations in the secular variation, of time scales of only a few years.  Global models have revealed the existence of core field pulses at three-year interval (Chulliat et al.,  2010; Finlay et al., 2015), which might be the result of magnetic Rossby waves propagating in a  stably stratified layer at the top of the core (Chulliat et al., 2015). The existence of such a layer  would be in agreement with recent results from seismic data (Hellfrich and Kaneshima, 2010) and  observations of MAC waves from historical magnetic data (Buffett, 2014), but in contradiction to the  dominant scenario of a fully-mixed outer core. Key research questions in the coming years will be to  understand what produces rapid fluctuations in the core field and investigate to which extent such  fluctuations can be forecasted.   b. Improving the separation of internal and external magnetic fields. The geomagnetic field is  comprised of many sources, some of which originate in the Earth’s interior (internal sources), while  others originate in the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere (external sources). When  investigating core flows, secular variation and acceleration, mantle resistivity and induction, or  small-scale crustal fields, great care must be taken to separate the source of interest from the  complex external fields. In the past decade, data from the CHAMP and Swarm satellites enabled the  detection and characterization of various ionospheric current systems (e.g., Stolle et al, 2006; Alken  and Maus, 2010; Iyemori et al, 2015) and the global modeling of the large-scale magnetospheric  field and its induced counterpart at ground and LEO altitudes (Maus and Lühr, 2005). These  progresses have led to new questions regarding the spatial structure of the many different  ionospheric and magnetospheric current systems, their temporal evolution during quiet and  disturbed times and how our knowledge of these currents can be used to improve geomagnetic  models.   c. Detecting ocean circulation generated magnetic signals. The Ocean’s salinity provides it a significant  electrical conductivity. All forms of ocean flow pass through the Earth’s main magnetic field  generating electrical currents that in turn induce secondary electromagnetic field bearing the  signature of the water transport. The oceanic motion induced magnetic anomalies have been  predicted at sea level and at satellite altitudes (e.g., Manoj et al. 2006). The tidal ocean signal has  been recognized from the magnetic measurements of the CHAMP satellite (Tyler et al. 2003). But  magnetic anomalies from the non-tidal part of the oceanic circulation have not yet been detected in  satellite magnetic data. Identification of magnetic signals from the ocean circulation in satellite data  could help further our knowledge on global transport of heat, chemicals (e.g. CO2) and nutrients for  marine life.   2) Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Today, NOAA’s models are in high demand by government and industry. The WMM is DoD’s standard  model and its performances have to meet military specification MIL-89500. Advanced models, such as  the EMM and HDGM, are part of a broader research field investigating alternate (non-GPS) navigation  technologies relying on a naturally occurring measurement sources. Further development and  improvement of the EMM and HDGM will be needed to harness the full potential of geomagnetic     4     models for navigation in both the military and civilian realms. Basic research on the various geomagnetic  sources, and particularly the questions outlined in section 1, is a prerequisite to achieving such  improvements. This is all the more true now that the research focus is on the smallest contributions to  the total geomagnetic field, which are harder to properly characterize and separate from each other.   After 15 years of nearly-continuous space-based observations, several research groups in the U.S. and in  Europe have established themselves as experts in geomagnetic modeling. The preparation of the  ongoing Swarm mission catalyzed collaborations among these groups, many of whom are part of  Swarm’s Satellite Constellation Application and Research Facility (SCARF) consortium (Olsen et al., 2013).  It led to the emergence of constellation-based geomagnetic modeling as a new technique whose  potential has yet to be fully realized. Moreover, after three successful missions (Ørsted, CHAMP and  Swarm), the technology of high-precision magnetic measurements in LEO is mature and could easily be  reused in future missions.    3) Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   None of the challenges/questions listed in section 1 can be successfully addressed without a nearly- continuous stream of high-precision, global, space-based magnetic measurements in the coming  decade. This applies both to ensuring continuity of the WMM and improving the EMM and HDGM.   Today, space-based observations are provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission,  which comprises three LEO satellites. Swarm was launched in November 2013 and will fly until 2018,  with possible extension until 2021 (to be decided in 2017). It provides unrestricted data access to U.S.  scientists and effectively meets current needs for space-based geomagnetic observations. However,  there currently is no funded magnetic satellite project for the second part of the upcoming decade.    Figure 1 shows what the impact would be on the WMM if no satellite were to be launched by 2025. The  model would be unable to meet the military specification for the declination a high-latitudes, even at  the beginning of the validity interval. This is because, in the absence of satellite data, models such as the  WMM are solely based upon ground data that are too geographically sparse to enable accurate  determination of the smaller spatial scales. Ground data are provided by the global network of magnetic  observatories, including the 14 observatories operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It  is worth noting that observatory data, although not sufficient to build accurate global models, are  included in many such models and extensively used in validating them.    Magnetic observations from non-dedicated satellite missions, such as the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program (DMSP), are also useful for geomagnetic modeling and have recently been used to  bridge a gap in data availability between the CHAMP and Swarm missions (Alken et al, 2014). However,  the precision of such observations is not enough to address the research questions outlined in section 1  and operational models derived from them would be of significantly degraded quality compared to  current models.        5        Figure 1: Root-mean-square declination error of the WMM at high latitudes (>±55°). The total error is the  superposition of the error made by omitting the crustal and external fields in the model, and the error of the   model itself. The latter is very small at model epochs (2000, 2005, etc.) but increases in time due to the forecast  error. The actual error (inferred a posteriori) is shown from 2000 to 2015 (in blue). The military specification for   the WMM is shown as a black line. Estimated errors are shown after 2015, assuming Swarm continues until at least  2020, and a Swarm follow-on mission is launched (in green) or not (in red) before 2025.      Single satellites can rapidly orbit the planet, allowing the study of the geomagnetic field at many  different length scales, however only multi-satellite missions, sampling the field simultaneously at  different local times can also achieve the recovery of the temporal structure, which is crucial for  separating the many contributions to the total field, which all vary on different temporal and spatial  scales. Moreover, a pair of satellites flying side-by-side in an East-West configuration such as in Swarm  allows the use of the gradient information for detecting the smallest signals generated in the crust and  oceans. Improved models of various internal and external fields are already being developed based  upon Swarm data (e.g., Olsen et al, 2015) and the next generation of models will need to rely upon  future constellation missions.   In 2002, NASA’s Solid Earth Science Working Group (SESWG) made the case for continuous, space-based  geomagnetic observations and recommended the launch of constellations of magnetic satellites in  varying orbits (SESWG, 2002). This report was later reviewed by NRC, which “strongly supported these  recommendations and noted that the Swarm mission (…) planned for launch by the European Space  Agency in 2009 would largely satisfy the SESWG goals” (NRC, 2007). Fifteen years later, and as no Swarm     6     follow-on is planned, the case made by the SESWG is still valid and even further strengthened by the  new questions and challenges outlined in section 1. A future U.S. mission could build upon the  experience accumulated during the Swarm mission and aim for an even better designed constellation.      References   Alken, P., and S.

Platnick, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center  Athanasios Nenes, Georgia Institute of Technology    November 2, 2015    This white paper focuses on cloud modification by aerosols, collectively known as Aerosol- Cloud Interactions (ACI). ACI generally falls into two broad categories: cloud albedo/emissivity  effects and cloud lifetime/precipitation effects. The two categories encapsulate the following  physical processes taking place when aerosol perturbations interact with developing and/or  existing clouds: aerosol perturbations change the number concentration and size distribution of  cloud particles (droplets, ice crystals) which in turn change cloud radiative properties  (reflectance, transmittance, absorbtance/emittance); aerosols change cloud microphysical  characteristics (particle numbers and sizes, amount of condensate) in ways that affect the  temporal evolution of cloud systems and the amount, type (liquid, frozen), and onset/duration of  any precipitation they produce.   What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic  research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?   Anthropogenic aerosols induce a radiative forcing (RF) on the climate system through direct  interaction with atmospheric radiation (not discussed here), but also via modification of cloud  radiative properties (one of the subjects of this white paper). The latter forcing mechanism is  extremely important because even small cloud changes can have relatively large RF impacts  compared to those from changing concentrations of greenhouse gases. For instance, brighter  clouds due to ACI can partially or fully counteract warming by other forcing mechanisms.   Quantifying cloud changes due to aerosols poses a dual challenge from both observational and  modeling standpoints. Quite simply, it is difficult to attribute cloud changes solely to ACI, and it  is equally, if not more, challenging to seek observational confirmation of modeled ACI behavior.  A fundamental stumbling block in observing ACI is that retrievals of spatiotemporally collocated  aerosol and cloud properties are notoriously difficult. Not only are aerosols underneath and  above clouds hard to detect and characterize, except in specific configurations, and then only  with appropriate instrumentation, but even aerosols interspersed in the clear areas of cloud  formations cannot be measured accurately because of intricate cloud contamination effects.  Another critical aspect of ACI attribution is ensuring that comparisons between clean (low  aerosol loading) and polluted (high aerosol loading) conditions are performed for atmospheric  states that are otherwise the same. This makes imperative to infuse any attempts to observe ACI  with information about the instantaneous atmospheric state.   Lastly, a critical question is how susceptible current-day clouds are to ACI. This entails  essentially a breakdown of anthropogenic ACI already incurred vs ACI that can still occur. In  other words while strong ACI potential may exist for certain clouds and environments, for other  situations a large fraction of ACI may have already been realized (obviously, “reversal” of ACI     effects in a cleaner environment is also possible). Such a breakdown seems feasible only with a  coordinated approach that combines modeling (what has happened in the past or may occur in  the future) with observations (the current state of aerosols and clouds).    Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   With climate change upon us it is urgent to observe important components of the climate system  and narrow the range of model-based climate sensitivity (surface temperature change due to a  doubling of CO2). ACI affects the surface energy balance, possibly also the patterns and strength  of precipitation, and has even been suggested as a solar management technique in a  geoengineering context.   Our understanding of the type of measurements that are optimal in either separate or combined  configurations to retrieve aerosol and cloud properties, in isolation or co-occurrence settings, has  improved rapidly in recent years (e.g, the A-Train). Such measurements are a prerequisite for the  more challenging step of applying appropriate analysis to unearth the fingerprints of ACI. Of  utmost importance is coordination that allows both passive (imagers with and without  polarization/multi-angle capabilities, IR/MW sounders) and active (lidars, radars) views of  clouds and aerosols. The A-Train has many of these capabilities and has provided a glimpse of  what is potentially achievable, but not yet within reach. Much has been learned about  distinguishing between aerosols and thin clouds and other cloud contamination. EarthCare will  continue the motif with enhanced in some respects, and reduced in others, capabilities.  Operational LEO and GEO satellites have increasingly powerful and better characterized  instruments that can provide retrievals of reasonable quality for filling many sampling gaps.  Observations of precipitation will continue to improve with GPM-inspired technologies and  enhanced strategies on how to merge disparate rainfall products.   Modeling ACI has also made great leaps in a wide range of atmospheric model classes.  Increasing computer power allows implementation of ACI-relevant bin microphysics schemes  for aerosols and clouds in Cloud Resolving Models and Large Eddy Simulation Models. Even  atmospheric models with GCM heritage can now be run at high horizontal resolutions of ~10 km  or below where convection is explicitly resolved. Aerosol microphysical schemes and two- or  three-moment cloud schemes can now be accommodated in ~100 km resolution GCMs  representing explicit radiative and precipitation/lifetime aspects of ACI. It is critical that the  verisimilitude of all these models and schemes be validated against observations, and to establish  the best practices to accomplish this.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   Only space-based observations can offer global or near-global coverage to study a problem as  geographically diverse as ACI. Space views also provide the extensive spatial perspective that  allows us to compare nearly simultaneously ACI signals between similar cloud regimes affected  either weakly or strongly by aerosols. Moreover, from the vantage point of space certain  incarnations of ACI such as cloud brightening are easier to detect and monitor (think “ship  tracks”).     A key factor, of course, in deciding whether the costly investment of a space mission is justified  to study an important problem such as this is the technological maturity of the instruments to be  placed in orbit. Arguably, the technical readiness level is satisfactory and the prospects of further  improvement in the near future are very good (e.g., ACE-funded instrument development). A  variety of smaller-scale programs for pilot studies and missions will continue to inform the  appropriate sampling and spatiotemporal coverage strategies, orbital characteristics, and  coordination of measurements, including constellation configurations, ideally suited for  investigating ACI. Such programs have also been providing guidance on calibration  requirements and how to control payload size and power requirements.   Please focus on the role of space-based observations and comment on:   a. Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide the capabilities  necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions. If  not, what additional investments are needed?   Existing programs provide some capability to study ACI, but really are no more than a teaser on  what can be accomplished with better instruments and a sustained commitment on a multifaceted  optimized observation strategy. A major problem with several existing capabilities is that they  are approaching end-of-life; sustaining measurement coordination is already becoming  increasingly difficult. Existing and forthcoming operational GEO and LEO assets will help, but  they lack the specialized technology that intensive studies of ACI require. The planned PACE  mission has some ACI potential, especially if a polarimeter is added, but a different main focus is  expected to drive instrument and algorithm design away from ACI relevance.   To study ACI, monitoring of specific observables is required. For clouds this includes spatial  extent, vertical location, amount of condensate, and the number and size of particles; ideally we  also need vertical profiles of condensate and particles. We also need information on precipitation  including drizzle. From the aerosol side, we seek the vertical distribution of loading, particle size  and radiative properties, and, critically, the fraction of aerosol particles than can serve as cloud  condensation nuclei (liquid cloud) or ice nuclei (ice and mixed-phase clouds). Knowledge of  aerosol properties must extend to locations with frequent cloud presence. Also needed is updraft  velocity which determines the fraction of CCN and IN that activate/nucleate. Finally, knowledge  of the dynamic/thermodynamic environment in which clouds form is required.   The investments needed to study ACI were described in sufficient detail in various ACE study  reports submitted to NASA HQs. Skipping the details here due to space limitations, a mission to  study ACI would ideally require a combination of a high spectral resolution lidar, an imaging  polarimeter with multi-angle capability, W-band and multi-frequency Doppler radar, a wide  swath VIS-IR imager with  high resolution in parts of the spectrum, and microwave through  submillimeter radiometers. These instruments collectively provide the capability to measure  most of the observables listed above in mixed cloud-aerosol environments and at the resolutions  and sampling volumes necessary for process studies.   b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for  addressing key scientific questions and societal needs;     Space-based observations of ACI can benefit from ground capabilities that target aerosols and  cloud. Such capabilities include networks supported by US and international agencies, as well as  multi-instrument “supersites” at either fixed locations or deployed for particular campaigns.  Opportunities for collocated ground-suborbital-space measurements should be a major factor in  designing an ACI-focused space mission. For climate impact studies, space measurements  targeting ACI should be combined with a variety of other observations and re-analysis data that  resolve the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic structure, including temperature and  humidity, as well as surface conditions. Linking to simulations by cloud and global models is  also highly desirable.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits   The scientific and societal benefits stem from substantially better knowledge of the climate  system and the direction it is heading. Cloud feedback has the potential to be a strong factor in  how future climate will look like, yet it is so uncertain due to the difficulties of simulating  realistic clouds in climate models, that any leaps in monitoring cloud evolution in an  environment of manageable anthropogenic aerosol pollution will be an important factor in policy  making. The understanding and monitoring ACI is also paramount because of its prominence as  a potential solar radiation management technique.    d. The science communities that would be involved.    A wide range of science communities in the environmental, climate, weather, air quality, and  modeling arenas would potentially be involved. All are expected to influence the design and  implementation of enhanced ACI observations. The commitment to focus on ACI as a key  atmospheric process for climate change may influence the priorities of international meteorology  and climate coordinating groups and will certainly merit close scrutiny in future IPCC  assessments.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science  across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications,  and/or operations in the coming Decade?     The amplification of the hydrological cycle as a consequence of the  anthropogenic global change is shown to alter both the climate mean conditions  and the variability and to lead to more extreme intra-annual precipitation and  temperature regimes characterized by severe and persistent droughts and heat  waves (Huntington et al. 2006; IPCC, 2007; IPCC 2014).  Although forecasts of  more extreme rainfall regimes are now being corroborated, the ecological  impacts from this amplification remain incompletely understood and represent  an important research challenge for the scientific community (Jentsch et al. 2007;  Knapp et al. 2008). Developing a quantitative understanding of how drought  stress is changing across different ecosystems and continents is critical given that  the effects of increasingly variable precipitation patterns have been predicted to  rival the ecological impacts of other global-scale changes, including atmospheric  warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 mole fractions (Easterling et al. 2000,  Parmesan 2006, IPCC 2007; Knapp et al. 2008).    Ecosystems respond rapidly to climate extremes, but the nature of the responses  are poorly understood (Allen et al. 2015; Anderegg et al. 2015a; Choat et al. 2012).  For example, tree mortality, recruitment, and fire disturbances all have been  shown to respond more directly to regional extremes than more gradual long- term changes in the annual mean (Choat et al. 2012). Coupled climate-carbon  cycle models often assume that vegetation and ecosystem recovery from climate  extremes occurs rapidly because these models do not yet adequately represent  disturbance and recovery processes. Many studies have documented that  ecosystem recovery to extreme events can take years to decades (Anderegg et al.  2015b; Saatchi et al. 2013; Ciais et al. 2005). This delay in recovery slows  metabolic activities and vegetation growth, consequently interrupting ecosystem  carbon uptake. With more persistent and severe water stress, plant mortality  may increase to a level that tips regional ecosystems from a robust sink to a  source of carbon, leading to a significant positive climate feedback and  exacerbating climate warming trends (Friedlingstein et al. 2006).      If the carbon services of ecosystems are interrupted or decline significantly from  increasing water stress, the impacts will be detrimental to human society in  terms of environmental degradation, energy policies, food production and  security.  Despite the importance of water stress for ecosystem function, there  are currently no direct measurements of water stress at the integrated plant  canopy or community level and no capacity to systematically monitor  ecosystem water stress over regional, continental and global domains. Critical  Earth System Science challenges and questions linking the water stress to  ecosystem function and response include:      1. During drought events, plants experience water stress and potential  adverse ecological impacts, yet the question, how fast does the vegetation  respond to water stress? has not been addressed except in a handful of in- situ studies at the scale of individual trees or within the footprint of eddy  covariance towers. Responses at landscape, basin, and regional scales  remain almost completely unexplored. 2. In extreme or persistent dry conditions, the evaporative demand at the  canopy level cannot be met by the limited water supply at the soil level,  causing reductions in plant water content, embolism, and hydraulic  failure of water transport systems in vegetation, causing irreversible  damages that may ultimately lead to large-scale desiccation and mortality.   The question of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad  range of ecosystems and environments? remains a challenge to the science  community. 3. Predicting how forest ecosystems will respond to future climate changes  hinges on a quantitative understanding of the physiological mechanisms  governing drought stress and the response of vegetation productivity and  carbon dynamics. It is therefore important to know: What is the limit of  drought tolerance of different ecosystems?         2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially  with respect to readiness?   Given the increasing climate variability and higher probability of extreme events,  knowledge gaps regarding the behavior and potential response of ecosystems to  water stress are becoming more apparent. The functional role of terrestrial  ecosystems in the global carbon cycle depends strongly on rates of gross and net  primary production. These fluxes, in turn, depend strongly on adequate supplies  of plant-available water in soils to meet atmospheric moisture deficits driving  water losses through evapotranspiration.  Even relatively low levels of water  stress may have adverse impacts on ecosystem productivity and predispose  vegetation to mortality and shifts in community composition driven by other  factors, including insect defoliation and wildfire. Understanding the ecological  response to climate extremes requires simultaneous measurement of water stores  in plant, litter, and soil compartments as well as transport from the soil to the  canopy.  Results on individual experiments suggest that 70% of 226 forest trees species  over 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow hydraulic safety margins against  extreme levels of drought stress (Choat et al. 2012). Therefore, these forests,  potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature  and aridity increase, as predicted for many regions across the globe (Zhang et al.  2007).  These safety margins are shown to be largely independent of mean annual  precipitation, indicating that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of     all forests to drought, regardless of their current rainfall environment (Choat et  al. 2012; Manzoni et al. 2013; Anderegg et al. 2015b). Recent mega-droughts in  Amazonia and increasing mortality of trees at large scales suggest that drought- induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests  not normally considered at drought risk (Meir et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2009;  Saatchi et al. 2013).     One of the most promising methods for characterizing the sensitivity of plants to  drought stress is by quantifying the strength of the liquid (hydraulic) connection  between soil and leaves through the water-transporting xylem tissue (Choat et al.  2012). Measurements of the vertical water profile from root zone in soil to leaves  in the canopy along different ecosystem and environmental gradients will be  critical in addressing the response of ecosystems to water stress.      3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?     To address the above questions and challenges, a systematic observational  program is necessary to measure ecosystem water profiles globally on time scales  that will enable the study of changing hydraulic dynamics in vegetated  ecosystems.  Current in-situ observations include tree-level measurements  located in different field sites. There is no current capability to measure regional  environmental gradients or landscape scale variations as a function of ecosystem  composition, topography, and other environmental drivers.      Observations of the dynamics of water in soil-vegetation profile from space  provide a unique opportunity to examine the spatial and temporal variations of  ecosystem stress and drought response globally (Schimel et al. 2015).  The spatial  resolution of the observation must capture landscape scale variations of the  ecosystems (~ 0.1-1 km) and the temporal resolution must capture daily to  seasonal (3-7 days) variations.  These measurements can be directed towards  local early morning and late afternoon LEO overpasses (6 am, 6 pm local time) to  allow sampling of the water profile at approximately the maximum level after  recharge and the minimum level after daily evapotranspiration (ET) and  photosynthetic activities respectively.  Potential orbital complexity for diurnal  observations of the water profile can provide a direct linkage to carbon  assimilation processes and the mechanisms of stress, rates of recharge and  recovery, and integrated ecosystem response (Golden et al. 2004; Doughty and  Golden, 2008).  In addition, long time series records are needed to characterize  the interannual variability of the water column in soil and vegetation, and the  legacy of water stress on ecosystem hydro-ecological state.          a) Whether existing and planned U.S. and international programs will provide  the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified  challenge and associated questions. If not, what additional investments are  needed?     For the space observation of water profile in soil and vegetation, multi-frequency  active microwave remote sensing measurements (radar sensors), ranging from  the longest possible wavelength for root zone soil moisture to shorter  wavelengths for the canopy water content are required (Moghaddam et al. 2000;  Entekhabi et al. 2010; Troung-Loi et al. 2015; Saatchi and Moghaddam, 2000; lee  et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2014).  This approach was recommended by the decadal  survey in 2007 as the spaceborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and  Subsurface (MOSS) mission as a key component in a future integrated water and  energy cycle observing system.  A desirable approach includes a minimum of two frequencies at P-band (with a  wavelength of about 70 cm) and L-band (24 cm wavelength) to enable the  separation of water content among root zone, surface soil moisture, and upper  canopy water pools (LeToan et al. 2011; Saatchi et al. 2011; Sandberg et al., 2011).   Addition of Other frequencies such as C-band (~ 5 cm wavelength), or X-band (~  3 cm wavelength), or Ku bands (~ 2 cm) can enhance delineation of vertical  canopy water profile measurements with greater sensitivity to canopy moisture  variations.   None of the current capability from NASA and other space programs (SMAP,  NISAR, BIOMASS, SAOCOM, ALOS, etc.) are not designed and configured to  provide daily or sub-weekly observations of water status in soil and vegetation  layers over forest ecosystems globally.  However, the existing and planned  sensors all point to the fact that the technological readiness level for  measurements of multi-frequency radar is high.        b) How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase  the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs?    In situ measurements at tree level but distributed along local environmental  gradients in research plots or flux tower sites globally can illuminate the basic  mechanisms of water profile variations over diurnal to seasonal cycles. These  measurements can provide the basic information for developing the architecture,  including requirements for spectral, spatial and temporal sampling.  Multi- frequency radar observations from existing airborne platforms over ecosystems  with different structure and environmental gradients, and large-scale field  campaigns such as NASA’s AirMOSS, ABoVE can provide the data necessary for  developing algorithms and quantifying the uncertainty of measurements of the  water profile in soil and vegetation. By combining a profiling radar system with  fluorescence (from OCO-2, and follow on missions) and terrestrial water storage     anomalies (from the GRACE follow-on mission), it will be possible to obtain an  integrated regional perspective of carbon cycle responses to drought stress.     c) The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and     The consequences of these changes from increasing climate extremes are  immediate and are being observed in different ecosystems and environments.  These changes may fundamentally alter the distribution and capacity for  ecosystem goods and services, including potential degradation of NPP, water  availability, and food security. Measurements of water profile in soil-vegetation  layers will significantly improve integrated carbon and climate models by  providing the mechanisms for predicting the legacy of drought and resilience of  ecosystems.  Reducing the uncertainty in predictions of ecosystem response will  improve our ability to assess vulnerability and manage ecosystems sustainably.     d) The science communities that would be involved.    Understanding and monitoring the ecosystem responses to extreme water stress  requires a multi-disciplinary approach than spans hydrology, ecosystem ecology,  atmospheric composition, and carbon cycle communities. The new water profile  measurements proposed here would enable rapid conceptual breakthroughs at  the intersection of these disciplines and would require extensive integration of  remote sensing, field and modeling approaches.

File of White Paper (1500 word limit):  Infrared Radiance Intercalibration for Climate Quality Products and Benchmarking  Principal Author: David Tobin Co-authors: Tim Hewison, Henry Revercomb, Bruce Wielicki  There are many Earth system investigations of climate related processes and climate change that rely on observations which do not have the inherent accuracy and traceability desired for the intended use.  That is, data from sensors designed and tested based on weather related specifications are frequently used in studies to understand and track climate, yet lacking the required basic measurement characteristics.  Therefore, a key challenge which spans innumerous Earth System Science applications is to understand, and improve if possible, the accuracy of NOAA, NASA, and international satellite products.  In particular, a challenge is to improve the radiance calibration accuracy of the large suite of infrared sensor observations including those from, for example, AIRS, IASI, CrIS, MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, HIRS, and GOES.   This improvement is possible with the proposed Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission (Wielicki et al. 2013) which would provide coincident infrared observations that can be used for intercalibration.  CLARREO will provide infrared observations with absolute calibration with uncertainty better than 0.1K 3-sigma and with in-orbit calibration verification.  Analogous improvements for reflected solar observations are also possible via high accuracy CLARREO reflected solar observations.   The resulting improved calibration and characterization of the calibration uncertainties will provide benefits in two main areas: 1) improved radiances and derived products from the individual intercalibrated sensors, and 2) the ability of the intercalibrated radiance observations to contribute to the construction of a climate radiance benchmark.   The need for this type of reference observation capability is recognized and has been discussed in recent publications.  For example, the need is summarized in the 2013 WMO/CEOS/CGMS report “Strategy Towards an Architecture for Climate Monitoring from Space” (Dowell et al. 2013):  “To characterize climate and climate change, data need to be accurate and homogeneous over long time scales. The signals important for the detection of climate change can easily be lost in the noise of a changing observing system. This enforces the need for continuity in an observing system, where observations can be tied to an invariant reference. Such a system needs to be maintained over at least several decades and beyond. It is with these boundary conditions that a climate monitoring architecture needs to be formulated.” Currently the international intercalibration community, organized around the Global Space based Inter Calibration System (GSICS, Goldberg et al. 2011), utilizes IASI, AIRS, and CrIS to serve as “reference sensors” for the intercalibration of other infrared observations, despite the relatively large uncertainty in these observations and the lack of in-orbit verification and traceability that is needed for the rigorous metrology required for climate studies and associated societal decisions.  Other than CLARREO, there are no other existing or planned programs that will provide this capability.  This is a challenge which must involve improved spaced based observations, and other existing and planned programs lack the high accuracy and in-orbit traceability required for this challenge.   The CLARREO mission was chosen as one of four Tier 1 missions in the 2007 Decadal Survey, and is currently in an extended definition phase.  The science objectives (including this infrared intercalibration objective) and the required sensors for CLARREO are well defined and ready to go.  Now is a crucial time for this challenge, as direct comparisons of CLARREO observations with concurrent sensors, including AIRS with its record starting in 2003 and IASI-A in 2007, have the potential to provide valuable data on the accuracy of the existing datasets before these missions reach the end of their lifetimes.  There are many groups that will potentially be included in these intercalibration efforts, including the CLARREO science team, other various individual sensors and product teams, and the intercalibration community, namely GSICS.  The CLARREO mission, with its primary climate benchmarking objective along with its potential benefits for the entire suite of infrared sensor observations via intercalibration, is certainly important for this Decadal Survey and deserves a strong recommendation to proceed expeditiously.

This has been driven  by a growing consensus that changes in glaciers and ice sheets are sufficiently large and  rapid to cause significant changes in sea level, and by concerns about the future  availability of water supplies for populated areas downstream of glacier catchments; both  of these will have severe impacts on human activities.  Recent independent satellite- derived estimates, using three techniques1, show clear agreement of accelerated ice mass  loss in Antarctica, Greenland, and glaciers worldwide, and have focused our attention on  changes in the land ice. Loss of land ice is an example of the effects of a changing  climate on large-scale earth systems. Current scientific consensus suggests that large  losses in land ice will continue in the coming decades, likely with increasing magnitude  and visibility.    This white paper addresses the needs of the scientific community for observations of  glacier and ice-sheet, changes that are required for improved decadal- to centennial-scale  estimates of land-ice change.  The goals to be addressed are:     I. To measure the present rate of change of each component of land ice with  sufficient spatial and temporal sampling required for attribution (atmosphere,  ocean, or internal forcing?)     II. To use these data and improved understanding in glacier and ice-sheet models  to estimate the sensitivity of land ice change to climate and ocean forcing.      Glaciers   1The three techniques for estimating mass loss are: 1) satellite altimetry which gives  direct estimates of height/volume/mass changes; 2) satellite gravity which gives direct  estimates of mass change; and 3) mass-flux method which uses InSAR-derived velocity  and altimeter-derived ice thickness.    Mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets accounted for nearly two thirds of the sea-level  rise observed between 2003 and 2009 (Shepherd and others, 2012, Gardner and others,  2013).  Glaciers contain only a small fraction of land ice and the sea-level rise equivalent  of the remaining glaciers is less than 0.41 m (Vaughan and others., IPCC AR5, 2014).   Glaciers are, however, currently losing mass at a rate comparable to the ice sheets, and  are expected to continue to do so for the next century and a little beyond (Marzeion and  others, 2014)  (Radić and others, 2013); therefore, they are of first-order importance to  NASA’s goal to better understand the roles and interactions of the ocean, atmosphere,  land and ice in the climate system (NASA Science plan, 2014).  Characterization of the  causal processes controlling observed changes in glacier mass require temporally- and  spatially-resolved estimates of glacier mass change. Knowledge of regional-scale glacier  mass changes comes primarily from airborne and satellite geodetic assessments (changes  in height and/or gravity) and numerical modeling efforts validated against in situ records  (Gardner and others, 2011, Lenaerts and others, 2013).    Only within the last decade have near-global geodetic assessments of glacier change  become possible, as a result of complementary height and gravity data collected by  NASA’s ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) and GRACE (Gravity  Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites, respectively (Gardner and others, 2013,  Jacob and others, 2012).  After the end of the ICESat mission in 2009, the GRACE  satellites became the only NASA satellites to continue global-scale analysis of glacier  mass changes until ICESat-2 and GRACE Follow On are launched in late 2017. GRACE  is able to directly measure the redistribution of mass around the Earth but is limited by  coarse spatial resolution (~300 km) and the requirement for detailed knowledge of non- glacier sources of near-surface mass variation, such as glacier isotactic adjustment and  changes in terrestrial water storage. These limitations make the attribution of the  processes responsible for the observed mass changes exceedingly challenging.     Measuring changes in subpolar glaciers with sufficient resolution to understand the  processes and sensitivities in the coupled ice-atmosphere system requires an  improvement in our capability for high-resolution geodetic measurements.  In general,  this requires two or more well-timed measurements of surface height per year for each  glacier worldwide.  While ICESat-2 will improve on estimates made using ICESat data,  primarily by providing denser spatial coverage at sub-polar latitudes, it will still only give  sparse repeat coverage for most small glaciers and ice caps such that glaciological studies  based on these data will require ancillary reference heights. Currently, data of this type  are available to US researchers from non-NASA sources including the Worldview  satellites (coordinated through the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of  Minnesota) and the German TanDEM-X satellite constellation; the former is not  guaranteed to continue in the future, and the latter can be prohibitively costly for routine  monitoring over large areas.     Ice sheets    The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have a combined sea-level rise potential of 66 m  (Vaughan et al., IPCC AR5, 2014). We divide the ice sheets into three categories based     on the different measurement requirements of each: coastal ice-sheets and outlet glaciers,  ice sheet interiors, and Antarctic ice shelves.     Coastal ice-sheets and outlet glaciers    Ice loss from the coastal regions of ice sheets has outpaced modest changes occurring in  their interiors since the late 1990s in Greenland and more recently in Antarctica (Krabill  and others, 2000, Harig & Simons, 2015). This increasingly negative mass balance is due  to processes related to surface mass balance and changes in ice discharge as glaciers react  to changing environmental conditions (van den Broeke and others, 2009, Velicogna and  others, 2014). Both melt-induced and dynamic mass losses exhibit rapid short-term  fluctuations and large spatial variability, indicating the complexity of surface processes  and the ice sheets’ response to climate forcing (Csatho and others, 2014). Moreover,  dynamic processes could lead to rapid collapses of large marine-based sectors of the ice  sheets (Joughin and others, 2014).    Extrapolation of the current behavior into the future could yield erroneous long-term  trends, because of our incomplete understanding of the complex interplay between the  major earth systems (ice sheet, atmosphere, ocean, solid earth). Continued monitoring of  ice sheet surface elevation and velocity with improved temporal and spatial resolution  along the coastal regions of ice sheets are required to improve ice sheet and coupled ice- atmosphere-ocean models, which will lead to reduced uncertainties in sea-level  predictions.    Ice-sheet interiors    One important challenge in the next decades will be to understand changes in the interior  of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. While ongoing changes are likely to be subtle  compared to the meter-scale vertical changes measured near the coasts and in subpolar  glaciers, the volume of ice and the area of its interface with the atmosphere are both large.   For example, a 7 cm per year water-equivalent change in ice thickness distributed over  the 14 million square km surface area of Antarctica would roughly equal the currently  observed sea-level rise of 3 mm/yr.  Geodetic estimates of ice-sheet change, particularly  in combination with gravimetric estimates that measure changes in the mass of the ice  sheet and the bedrock beneath it, can provide direct estimates of the contribution of the  ice sheets to sea-level change.     Interpretation of measured changes in surface elevation are confounded by short term  processes such as snow accumulation and subsequent densification to firn then to glacier  ice, and, for grounded ice, by solid earth processes that act on continental scales, such as  post-glacial rebound. While solid-earth processes induce a generally constant rate of  height change over the timescale of an altimetry mission and are correlated over long  spatial scales, surface mass balance processes induce height changes over timescales  from hours to years and vary over spatial scales of hundreds of meters to hundreds of  kilometers. Thus, they have a first-order contribution to height change measurements  (Shepherd and others, 2012). As snow accumulates on glaciers and ice sheets, the surface     height increases. In warmer regions of the ice sheets, this height increase is  counterbalanced by episodic melting; in colder regions it is offset by the slow  densification of snow into ice. This interplay between accumulation and densification is a  function of the snow temperature profile and the snow accumulation rate. Consequently,  conversion of height change estimates into mass balance estimates requires a robust  characterization of the snow accumulation and surface temperature changes that drive  height changes on short space and time scales. Any geodetic program must therefore  combine well-calibrated height change measurements with state-of-the-art surface mass  balance studies.    Estimates of ice-sheet mass balance spanning multiple decades may be less affected by  fluctuations in the near-surface density than those that rely on short observation periods.   Historical data span more than two decades and include satellite radar altimeters (RAs)  aboard ESA’s ERS-1 (1992-1996) and ERS-2 (2003) and Envisat (2002-2012), and laser  altimetry from ICESat (2003-09). Current and planned missions include RA from  Cryosat-2 (2010-present), altiKA (2013-) and Sentinel-3 (2015-), and laser altimetry from  ICESat-2 (2017-), together with airborne laser altimetry from IceBridge and previous  NASA missions (1992-).  RA data have an unknown, potentially large (Nilsson et al.,  2014), sensitivity to surface condition changes that is likely not consistent between  missions, which limits their usability for measuring long-term changes; laser altimeter  data offer a more precise estimate of surface height and a smaller sensitivity to surface  changes, but, even at the end of the ICESat-2 mission, will have a shorter epoch.   Improving our understanding of interior ice-sheet mass balance will require improved  models of biases for historical radar altimetry data,  as well as laser-altimetry missions  that continue beyond the predicted lifetime of ICESat-2.      Antarctic ice shelves  Antarctica’s ice shelves provide mechanical support that ‘buttresses’ the seaward flow  of grounded ice, so that ice-shelf thinning and retreat result in enhanced ice loss to the  ocean (Rignot and others, 2004, Scambos and others, 2004).  Accelerated ice-shelf  thinning and grounding line retreat over the past two decades raises concerns about  future loss of grounded ice and resulting sea level rise. All of the regions of large  grounded-ice height changes seen from satellite altimetry (Zwally and others, 2005,  Shepherd and others, 2012, Pritchard and others, 2009) are associated with shrinking or  disintegrated ice shelves. If present climate forcing is sustained, we expect there will  be a significant reduction in floating-ice at decadal-to-century time scales, leading to  the loss of buttressing and to increases in grounded-ice loss and grounding-line retreat.  An 18-year time series of ice-shelf thickness estimates constructed from ERS-1, ERS-2  and Envisat RA height data (Paolo and others, 2015) demonstrates that the thickness  varies on annual and decadal timescales, implying that results from single satellite  missions over a few years are insufficient to draw conclusions about long-term ice- shelf changes.    Understanding ice-shelf change requires observations at ~km spatial scales relevant to ice  shelf processes and on temporal scales that are sufficient to capture seasonal and annual     changes. Geodetic change monitoring on ice shelves is rendered more difficult than that  for grounded ice, because ice shelves are floating, and so the surface height changes by  approximately 10 cm for every ice-equivalent meter of mass gained or lost.  Further, the  motion of km-scale features that move with the ice-shelf surface can also lead to apparent  surface-height changes, whose effects can best be corrected if contemporaneous surface- velocity data are available (Moholdt and others, 2014). This implies that the ice shelves  need to be continuously monitored at fine spatial resolution and that future altimetry  missions should be planned so that they overlap.  It also suggests that ice-shelf height  change measurements must be made at decimeter precision, and that corrections need to  be developed for changes in the firn column, which can introduce large biases into ice- shelf melt-rate estimates.    Summary    The largest unknown contribution to future global mean sea-level change likely will  come from changes in land ice, in response to atmospheric, oceanic and internal forcing.  A better understanding of ice-mass loss processes and forcing mechanisms is required for  improving models that project future changes in sea level and availability of water  resources. One way forward is to observe land-ice change over long time periods and  then empirically relate observations to ocean and atmospheric variability. This requires  repeat measurements of surface elevation on temporal and spatial scales that can only be  accomplished through space observations.  Satellite altimetry is the only technique that  has the spatial and temporal resolution required to more fully understand the processes  leading to the mass change. Satellite gravity data provide important independent data to  identify which regions are losing mass.    We recommend that NASA’s portfolio missions over the next decade include:     --Temporally continuous or overlapping satellite laser altimetry that cover  glaciers and both ice sheets     -- Temporally continuous or overlapping and satellite gravimetry missions that  that cover glaciers and both ice sheets     --High-resolution photogrammetry and/or synthetic-aperture radar missions to  measure velocity and geometry changes in glaciers, ice shelves, and ice-sheet margins.    To fully recognize the explanatory power of satellite altimetry, we further recommend  additional investments need to be made not only in the satellite instruments but also into  understanding firn and surface-mass-balance processes.

I’d only suggest adding the following paragraph (most probably to Question/Section 3) to give a general background about the benefits of RS data for PH applied research including related Water Quality applied research:“A major challenge in studying the relationship between water pollution and human health outcomes is characterization of population-level or individual-level exposures. Human exposure measurements are typically estimated by relying on environmental measures available from ground-based water monitoring networks. Although ground-based monitors provide the best characterization of pollutant concentration levels at the specific places and times they are available, temporal and spatial gaps in these data can limit their applicability for exposure assessment in health studies. Available fixed-site water quality monitoring stations tend to be located strategically in areas, where population density is high. Thus, many epidemiology studies examining the association between the environment and health have had to rely on measurements from stationary monitoring sites located at substantial distances from where study participants actually live or work. Moreover, the frequency of measurement at the fixed sites varies from hourly to once every several days across monitoring sites. One promising method for characterizing environmental exposure for public health practice and epidemiologic research is the integration of remote sensing satellite systems data with monitoring network data. Use of remotely sensed data can be helpful for filling the temporal and spatial gaps found with ground-level monitor data.”  What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  The major key challenge for human health and water quality research in Earth System Science is the availability of satellite data sets that quantify strategic spectral characteristics of land, water, and atmosphere simultaneously from the visible through the thermal infrared spectrum. It is critical that these data provide sufficient spectral (i.e., channel selection and bandwidth), spatial, and temporal (e.g., satellite overpass repeat cycle and seasonal) resolutions to measure (directly or through algorithms) and to evaluate both environmental (state functions) and interface (process functions). This kind of Earth System Science data are critically important to understand vector borne and direct transmitted disease life cycles on a global scale within a regional and local habitat-host community context.  Landscape epidemiology involves the integration of epidemiological data (active or passive surveillance data) with climate, environmental, and ecological data.  Surveillance and response systems for public health are often based on case detection so that the epidemiologic unit is in fact the habitat-household. Data are then aggregated to community and regional scales. The use of satellite data sets combined with landscape epidemiology will provide an understanding of the relationships between ecology and infection and ultimately to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of pathogens, vectors, and/or hosts.   Key science questions and challenges are related to the ability to understand and quantify the environmental state and process functions that are significant in disease life cycles. The environmental state functions include precipitation, solar radiation, the surface energy budget which drives evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficits, air, surface, and soil temperatures; and surface hydrology (flooding and water bodies).  Process functions require the quantification of the thermodynamic and functional dynamics of ecosystems. These complex science questions require measurements of leaf level photosynthesis and biochemistry processes; CO2 exchange; leaf nutrient content; temperature, and transpiration (energy budgets).  At a larger scale the determination of leaf area index; canopy structure and architecture; nutrient and water cycles; phenology; identification of key species; and landscape scale ecological functional types are critical.  Currently existing satellites do not meet all of spectral, spatial, and temporal requirements to define and quantify the multi-factorial relationships among vector borne disease hosts, agents, vectors and the environment on a global scale. Planned missions such as NASA’s Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) is a global mission will provide continuous spectral measurements in the visible to short-wavelength infrared (VSWIR: 380 to 2510 nm) portion of the spectrum and measurements from eight discrete multi-spectral bands in the thermal infrared (TIR: 3 to 13 microns). HyspIRI addresses the needed spectral and spatial requirements for the study of vector borne diseases and other public health concerns. However, the temporal resolution of 16 days for the visible-short wave infrared and 5 days for the thermal is not sufficient to monitor dynamic public health concerns relating to disease out breaks. The impact of the longer repeat intervals is particularly critical in tropical regions and in areas with persistent cloud cover resulting in minimal or poor quality data coverage. Additional investments are needed to obtain shorter observation intervals. A simple solution is to use a constellation of satellites placed in orbit to give the required repeat intervals.  Land-based sources of pollution are increasingly becoming a threat for water quality not only for humans, but for ecosystems of watersheds (e.g., fish and riparian species), marshlands, freshwater bodies, and coastal (e.g., kelp forests, mangroves, sea grass, and coral reefs) areas. Further, communicable diseases associated with flooding (heavy rainfall and overflow of rivers) are of great concern with extreme weather events associated with climate variability. Water-borne diseases and vector-borne diseases having a life-cycle in water are a collective concern as clean water sources worldwide become more of a depleted resource. The need for fine spatial resolution (30 m or better) is relevant for measuring the variables associated with water quality in watersheds and coastal areas where communicable diseases are present. Also, high spatiotemporal resolution (4 m or finer and daily to weekly) is critical for capturing variability of coastal plumes and blooms and freshwater algal blooms relevant to communicable diseases associated with aquatic areas.  The ability to provide satellite measurements in a range of spatial resolutions will enable integration of global-regional and habitat-household level data into scalable biology-based predictive models that factor-in the essential environmental and host behavioral drivers that control propagation and transmission of disease agents.  Both the satellite data sets and the derived data products need to be freely publically available on easily accessible portals with the capability to search specific satellite data sets and/or multiple types of satellite data in spectral space, time and in spatial context. It is also important that the data can be obtained either through a single individual search or from accessing the data by scripting for ingesting into routine data products.  A strong, well-funded applied sciences program is required to effectively link space-based observations to address the needs of broad-based user community.  Many projects funded by NASA’s Applied Sciences program have demonstrated that satellite observations can significantly enhance the capability of critical decision support systems in many public health applications. Typically, the majority of the costs associated with a satellite mission are incurred in mission development and infrastructure maintenance (operations and data systems) along with funding the scientific research. Only recently has NASA provided minimal support for applied scientists to be incorporated into the mission team.  A significant outcome from this change is an early adopters program. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) early adopters program was very successful in preparing both the scientific and applications community in the use of SMAP data. NASA’s current applied sciences program is woefully underfunded. Funding levels need to be increased significantly to successfully address the societal public health challenges with the incorporation of satellite data.  Application of satellite data products in public health has exhibited great promise for prospective forecasting of vector borne disease outbreaks, opening the door for public health intervention, thus providing many potentially significant economic and societal benefits to the world. Attaining this potential presents a complex challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a broad scientific community. Researchers in the public health fields, climate science, ecology, hydrology, agriculture, meteorology, and information science are just a few of the scientific communities participating. Additionally, scientists from social, political, and economics fields are a critical component.  Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to       readiness?   Vector borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging on a global scale. Vector-borne diseases were once a major public health concern only in tropical and subtropical areas, but today they are also an emerging threat for the continental and developed countries. Vector-borne diseases are among the most complex of all infectious diseases to prevent and control. Not only is it difficult to predict the habits of the vectors, but most vector-borne agents can infect animals as well. A recent example for the US has been the, rapid, unstoppable spread of West Nile virus (WNV). Another is Dengue fever which causes thousands of cases of illness in U.S. territories and U.S. travelers, and millions of cases worldwide. The globalization of many country’s regional economies, climate variability, and civil unrest have spurred rapid movements of large human populations along with many of the disease vectors and reservoirs. Landscape scale alteration in ecosystems and land use impact the distribution of vector habitat and their interaction with human populations. Witness the worldwide problems caused by the recent Ebola outbreak resulting in a firestorm of political reactions over proposing quarantine or travel bans. Populations can migrate for economic reasons if the environment changes in such a way to reduce their ability to harvest plants or animals. People may migrate with their parasites. Monitoring changes in the environment and understanding how this affects the economy of an area is another important application for space-based observations. The existing use of satellite observations in forecasting and monitoring vector borne diseases epidemiology has been successfully utilized for a limited number of vector borne diseases. A good example is use in predicting Rif Valley fever outbreaks which erupts in a 7-15-year cycle.  A combination of passive (Landsat) and active (SAR) remote sensing data products are used to evaluate flooding and vegetation changes related to the outbreaks. Currently, the research suggests that early warning, weeks to months in advance of disease emergence, may be possible for RVF. Currently existing satellites do not meet all of spectral, spatial, and temporal requirements to define and quantify these significant multi-factorial relationships affecting vector borne disease life cycles.  Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   The problems we face with human diseases are of a global nature but impact human populations on a local and regional scale. The epidemiological processes in diseases are complex and occur over a vast range of scales, from regional to habitat-household scale for individual agents. Space-based observations provide measurements of environmental state functions and the interfaces as process functions important to vector and disease life cycles (within vector) and are measured within spatial context to provide provide a time series of measurements globally. Many critical environmental data sets are not available due to a multitude of factors ranging from remoteness and accessibility to the areas of interest, lack of resources in underdeveloped countries for ground based monitoring, and civil strife. Characterization of ecosystem structure and functioning on a landscape scale can only be determined using remote sensing. Space-based observations can facilitate understanding how environmental variability is associated with not just vector-borne disease but a wide range of other important health issues. Local ecosystems are tightly associated with exposure to bacteria, viruses, protozoa and Helminth sp. infections that are directly transmitted from soil or water phases without a vector.  E.g. Seasonal variation in cases of cholera and typhoid caused by increases in the height of the water table which leads to an increased contamination of water courses with fecal matter from both and humans. Geohelminth infections including hookworms are present in the soil in areas of open defecation or poor sanitation infrastructure. The viability of eggs produced by worms is tightly associated with environmental conditions, so as the environment changes, so does the risk of transmission of helminthiasis infections.                                    /docProps/thumbnail.jpeg  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":"dale quattrochi::simon hook::christine lee::"}

Henze, Shannon L. Capps, Mark Shephard, Karen Cady- Pereira, Jesse Bash, Liye (Juliet) Zhu, Ming Luo.   to the 2017-2027 NRC Decadal Survey on Earth Science and Applications from Space  Contact: Daven K. Henze (daven.henze@colorado.edu),    November 09, 2015    Reactive nitrogen (Nr) has significant impacts on ecosystems, air quality, and climate; it is thus a  pollutant of critical concern for several reasons. Deposition of Nr in the U.S. has been found to  have causal impacts on acidification and N enrichment, leading to eutrophication, alterations of  primary productivity, algal blooms, and loss of biodiversity. However, existing national ambient  air quality standards have been shown to inadequately protect ecosystem welfare against these  threats, even in regions where Nr levels are declining owing to reductions in NOx emissions from  transportation and power generation. Simultaneously, the sensitivity of Nr deposition to  ammonia (NH3) emissions is increasing, as are NH3 emissions themselves. Meanwhile, efforts to  regulate Nr deposition have been stymied by uncertainties in Nr sources and in the relationship  between emissions and deposition as described by air quality models, largely owing to lack of  measurement constraints on key model species and processes.  In addition to the impacts of Nr  deposition on ecosystems, Nr species influence air quality and climate through their impacts on  aerosols and direct and indirect impacts on greenhouse gases such as N2O and O3. Nr mitigation  approaches must be balanced with the benefits of anthropogenic enhancement of nitrogen  fixation, which is essential for crop production and food security to support the world’s current  and future population.  Here we make the case that a geostationary satellite mission for North  America over the next decade is critical for addressing ecosystems, food security, air quality, and  climate management needs for reactive nitrogen.     1.What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of  basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?  A burgeoning challenge for air quality control is figuring out how to mitigate Nr deposition.  Many national parks and federally protected areas in the U.S. are currently subject to hazardous  levels of Nr deposition.  When deposited in excess (i.e., above critical loads), Nr can lead to soil  acidification, eutrophication of surface water, and nutrient imbalances in sensitive ecosystems.  Despite likely continued decreases in NOx emissions from transportation and power plants in the  U.S. in coming decades, critical load exceedances are estimated to persist in 2050 in most  national parks [Ellis et al., 2013].  Exceedances may even increase in locations already  exceeding critical loads such as Rocky Mountain National Park [Paulot et al., 2013].   Meanwhile, the roles of emissions of NOx, SOx and NH3 in governing Nr deposition are  undergoing a transitional phase, with reductions to the former two species being potentially  outweighed by increases in the latter.  Disentangling the relative importance of each is critical for  developing effective strategies for mitigating Nr deposition.  Simultaneously, application of NH3  for agricultural practices, which is essential yet currently unregulated, can be guided by regional  voluntary programs for best management practices as well as enhancements to alert systems     which are currently based only on meteorological forecasts (http://www.rmwarningsystem.com,  https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/AP_PO_Appendix-V-Options-to-Reduce- Ammonia-Emissions.pdf).    Reactive nitrogen species also impact air quality. NOx and NH3 directly contribute to fine  particulate matter concentrations (i.e., PM2.5) through formation of ammonium sulfate and  ammonium nitrate. These species constitute approximately half of the PM2.5 concentrations in the  U.S., which are responsible for more than 100,000 premature deaths per year [Fann et al., 2012];  NOx also contributes to health concerns via O3. The external air pollution damages of emissions  of NOx and NH3 owing to premature deaths are estimated to be tens to hundreds of thousands of  dollars per year per kg of N emitted, depending upon location and season [Fann et al., 2009;  Dedoussi and Barrett, 2014; Paulot and Jacob, 2014; Buonocore et al., 2014].    Climate forcing of greenhouse gases and aerosols are also impacted by Nr. The direct  preindustrial to present radiative forcing of ammonium nitrate aerosol has been estimated to be - 0.10 ± 0.04 W m-2 [Myhre et al., 2013] to -0.19 ± 0.18 W m-2 [Shindell et al., 2013]. The  presence of NH3 can impact the thermodynamic state of secondary inorganic aerosols, which can  modulate aerosol direct radiative forcing [Martin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008] as well as  indirect forcing through clouds [e.g., Abbatt et al., 2006; Sorooshian et al., 2008]. NH3 has also  been shown to promote the formation of absorbing organic aerosol compounds that exert a  positive radiative forcing [e.g., Bones et al., 2010; Updyke et al., 2012]. Additionally, N2O is a  potent greenhouse gas, with a 100-year global warming potential nearly 300 times stronger than  CO2 [Myhre et al., 2013], while NOx emissions contribute to the formation of O3, which is itself  a greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant. Lastly, deposition of Nr may alter the carbon cycle by  lowering biogenic CO2 emissions [Pinder et al., 2012, 2013].    Despite this vast array of important issues associated with Nr, our understanding of the sources  and distributions of Nr is severely limited.  National emissions inventories of NOx may have  uncertainties of 100% or more [Travis et al., 2015].  Inventories of NH3 are even less certain,  with constraints from bottom-up versus top-down approaches differing by factors of 2-5 in  specific seasons and locations [Zhu et al., 2013; Paulot et al., 2014; Nowak et al., 2012].  Annual  N2O budgets are better constrained globally, given its well-mixed distribution, but can contain  regional uncertainties up to 25% owing to seasonal variability and stratosphere-troposphere  exchange [e.g., Wells et al., 2015].  Constraining sources and distributions of Nr is thus an  outstanding challenge.     2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?  To understand the burgeoning nature of Nr as a pollutant, it is worth considering the status of  current U.S. legislation related to Nr. Primary NAAQS for NOx and PM2.5 as criteria pollutants  are already in place to mitigate ambient air pollution. The EPA has considered formation of air  quality standards to address the effects of reactive nitrogen deposition, including aquatic and  terrestrial acidification and nutrient enrichment. These new standards would be in the form of  secondary standards on SOx and NOx emissions, and air quality models would be used to relate  these to Nr deposition. As part of the EPA process of enforcing the Clean Air Act, this topic is  subject to periodic review, resulting in an Integrated Science Assessment in 2008 [EPA, 2008]; a     Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), an independent review board that provides  advice to the EPA, also reviewed the relevant science. While causal relationships were found,  both the EPA and CASAC determined that the information present at the time was insufficient to  warrant formation of a new secondary standard owing to uncertainties in how Nr would be  monitored and the reliability of air quality models.  The observational needs have only become  exacerbated by the increased complexity of the Nr sources included in such models, from the  bidirectional exchange of NH3 to online coupling of Nr soil pools with the atmosphere [e.g.,  Hudman et al., 2012; Bash et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2015b]. The time is thus ripe to bring new  measurements sources to bear on this problem.   3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?    There is a large data gap in measuring Nr that underscores the tremendous potential for refining  our understanding of Nr distributions using satellite observations.  Current and planned in situ  and space-born measurements are inadequate to holistically evaluate Nr as a pollutant, given  their short mission lifetime, limited spatial and temporal coverage, and the lack of co- measurements of Nr species (NH3, NO2, and N2O).   In situ observations are currently  insufficient, as highlighted in the EPA Integrated Science Assessment and CASAC reviews for  development of secondary standards to address deleterious levels of Nr deposition. The EPA has  routinely monitored NOx concentrations in more than 100 locations around the country. These  measurements, along with trends in remote sensing data, have helped establish the benefits of  regulations that lead to cuts in NOx emissions, with broad decreases to NO2 evident in much of  the country. However, many of the routine in situ measurements have contamination issues, and  are often a complex mixture – NOy – of various forms of nitrogen oxides. Widespread  monitoring of NH3 did not begin until 2007, with the introduction of the Ammonia Monitoring  Network [AMoN, Puchalski et al., 2011], which now includes more than 50 sites.  Both networks  however lack the spatial and temporal coverage to describe variability in NOx and NH3, whose  relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (~hours) leads to highly heterogeneous distributions that  are difficult to completely characterize throughout the country.    In the 2018-2019 timeframe, the TEMPO instrument [Hilsenrath and Chance, 2013] will begin  providing the first geostationary measurements of NO2 over North America. Not only will  TEMPO provide data at much higher spatial resolution than current satellites (2 × 5 km2), the  data will be available every hour, rather than once per day.  However, the lifetime of this  instrument is nominally only two years, which is too short to support long-term air quality  management needs, and the instrument will not be able to detect NH3 or N2O.    The potential value of space-born measurements of NH3 has been demonstrated in several recent  studies using current low-earth-orbit platforms, yet the current instruments have several critical  shortcomings in their ability to reduce our uncertainty in the sources and fates of NH3 , which  would be addressed by geostationary observations [Zhu et al., 2015a].  The first remote sensing  observations of lower tropospheric NH3 were from the TES instrument [Beer et al., 2008]. This  product was subsequently used to constrain NH3 emission in the U.S. in Zhu et al. [2013],  although success was limited owing to sparseness of quality TES data (a few hundred  measurements per month over North America). The IASI instrument is also capable of retrieving  NH3 [Clarisse et al., 2009]. With its scanning capabilities, IASI provides much greater spatial  coverage than TES; however, the spectral resolution of IASI is much lower, and given similar     instrument noise characteristics, its detection limits are higher than TES. More recently, NH3  retrievals have been generated from the CrIS instrument [Shephard and Cady-Pereira, 2015], a  scanning instrument with four times lower noise than TES or IASI, launched aboard the Suomi  National Polar-orbiting Partnership in 2011.  Still, these observations are limited in terms of the  temporal sampling necessary to evaluate the diurnal variability of Nr sources.    Despite these advances in surface monitoring and remote sensing of Nr, the scientific needs  continue to outpace the set of available measurements, which are insufficient to constrain key  uncertainties in current AQ models such as the diurnal variability of Nr emissions, their coupling  through soil processes and atmospheric interactions, and their response to changing levels of  associated compounds such as SOx [Zhu et al., 2015b; Bash et al., 2015]. As our air quality  models of these of processes evolve, and as new air quality policies are enacted that rely on such  models, there is a growing need to observe Nr at hourly and kilometer scales throughout North  America that can only be addressed by new geostationary remote sensing measurements.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum  of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming   decade?   An overarching question for the NASA science mission is “How is the Earth changing and what  are the consequences for life on Earth?”  Four key related questions were posed at a recent  workshop on Terrestrial Ecology, Carbon, Land Cover and Biodiversity: 1. How long can   Earth’s ecosystems sustain their functions as they are modified by climate and human activities?  2. How will water and food security be affected as climate changes and human consumption   intensifies; how will they respond to various policies aimed at adapting to and mitigating these   effects? 3. What are the consequences of significant changes to existing ecosystem services?  4.   Biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability are changing as a result of human alterations to the   landscape. What are the consequences for human well-being? The answers are to be found by   quantitative understanding and characterization of Earth' s biosphere which leads to accurate   models of ecosystem dynamics.  During the past 18 months members of the land science   communities have worked together to describe and prioritize measurements required to support   research objectives of these communities.  In addition, notional technical approaches (field,   suborbital and orbital) and frameworks to acquire the needed measurements were identified.    Several key scientists participated in a workshop and recently released a report on the findings.    Prominent among the findings of the workshop report (i.e., Goetz and Hall, 2015 and related   white paper submission) is the need for high definition ecosystem structure information:       `The ability to map ecosystem structure with greater certainty will in turn lead to more   certain estimates of ecosystem functions (photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration) as   they relate to structure. Lidar collections provide the cutting-edge structural details that   can contribute to better maps of ecosystem composition, especially in concert with the   differentiating spectral information provided by imaging spectrometry. Image time series   can contribute the best available synoptic information regarding vegetation phenologies,   providing yet further information for characterizing composition, as well as function.   Radar is helpful for mapping ecosystem structure at larger scales than can be currently   characterized synoptically with lidar. `      The latest IPCC Assessment Report (2014) report noted there is high confidence that carbon   stored (i.e., biomass) in the terrestrial biosphere is susceptible to loss to the atmosphere as a   result of climate change, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. Another workshop on   Carbon and Climate (Schimel et al., 2015) focused on large scale modeling and stated biomass (   (a component of vegetation structure) measurements provide a long-term integral constraint on   land carbon fluxes and repeated measurements of biomass provide a decadal scale constraint on   land-atmosphere models. The report pointed out that contemporary missions such as ALOS-    PALSAR and planned missions like GEDI, BIOMASS, and NISAR) may provide measurements   of carbon stocks in the current era.  The aforementioned systems should do a credible job of   estimating the state of global biomass.  The purpose of this white paper is to advocate for   detailed understanding of ecosystem structure and functions that require measurements not   captured by these missions.    2.   Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to  readiness?    A high priority measurement need identified by all carbon cycle discipline groups was the   missing hi-resolution vertical dimension of vegetation and surface structures. According to the   Schimel et al. report the vertical information component could be acquired from lidar and radar   (e.g. GEDI, IceSat-2, NISAR and BIOMASS missions that are already planned for this decade).    This is true when considering canopy height as the driving variable for biomass estimation,   however, measurements from these systems do not provide sufficient details of surface and   canopy structures.  These planned missions are an attempt to address key issues regarding forest   biomass as called for in the first Earth Sciences Decadal survey and should provide for the first   time global higher resolution (10s of meters) observations that can be used to estimate forest   biomass based on estimates of lidar derived heights or scattering phase center heights.  The   planned measurements may either be spatially discontinuous, lack global coverage, or lack   spatial detail.    Key challenges for acquiring necessary three-dimensional structure information of vegetated   ecosystems include detailed vertical knowledge along with temporal and spatial coverage.  What   is critically needed in the next decade is detailed contiguous along and across track observations   of canopy structure., i.e. 3-D swath maps.  Accurate and high-resolution measurements of 3D   structure are critical for knowledge of above ground and below ground carbon in forests (e.g.,   Naessett and Gobakken 2008)).  In addition detailed and high-density 3D measurements provide   information of ecosystem structure that can be applied to the understanding of impacts on   biodiversity from natural and anthropogenic sources (Bergen et al. 2009).  For example, subtle   but extensive changes such as permafrost thaw could impact traditional food and shelter   resources for animals and humans across the Arctic zone.  Changes in ecosystem structure from   establishment of new species in formerly unsuitable habitats can impact ecosystem health and   services.  Disturbance frequency and impact may increase in the face of climate change, as may   the frequency and severity of natural hazards.  Sampling biomass, as mentioned above, helps the   understanding of the state of carbon, and 3-D mapping of carbon will provide insight into the   fate of carbon in vegetation and the consequences for other life forms including humans.     Annual measurements of the three-dimensional structure of vegetation at meter scale horizontal   resolution and sub-meter vertical resolution are required to characterize and quantify change in   ecosystem structure and the implications for carbon balance, biodiversity and ecosystem   structure.  Technologies exist now to acquire these measurements.  For example, new US   government policies are making commercial high resolution ( i.e., sub-meter) stereo imagery   available to scientists and detailed structure information is being gained ( e.g., Neigh et al, 2013,   Montesano et al 2105). These types of measurements have shown promise for characterizing   forest canopy height models but lack accurate surface elevation vertical canopy.  Spatial and   temporal acquisition strategies limit the usefulness of these data for detailed ecosystem dynamics   studies.. A combination of contiguous, repeatable high-resolution stereo-imagery with   contemporary high density lidar retrievals provides a tractable approach.       We envision a system that can characterize the 3-D structure of vegetated ecosystems with   ground swath of 10s of kilometers supported by detailed and contiguous vertical vegetation   structure and ground elevation measurements.  This imaging/structural solution should provide   swath coverage  of high resolution (sub-meter), have carefully chosen multispectral bands, and   of course be well-calibrated.  An imbedded array of high resolution vertical structure   measurements ( e.g.multicolor, waveform or high repetition rate photon counting lidar) would   provide contemporary detailed structure and surface elevation measurements not obtained by the   imaging system.  Repeated swath measurements frequent enough to capture important   phenological or growth stages that can be used to assess productivity and viability within regions   undergoing rapid change are also required.  The mutispectral bands of interest include those   necessary for vegetation density, composition and productivity.  Vertical profile measurements   that capture complete (i.e., ground to canopy top) structure should be measured contiguously   along track at high resolution (~1m).  These data will provide further insights into the full 3D   structure, composition and functioning of vegetation that can fused with the larger swath   instrument data.  Multiple across-track footprints would be especially useful in this context.  This   would be especially valuable at orbit crossover points and will provide highly detailed maps of   ecosystem change.     The complete data set will offer powerful synergies with other remote sensing and in situ   observations.  For example, coincident observation of swaths by optical instruments such as   Landsat or instruments that are sensitive to photosynthetic rates (e.g., ESA FLEX, NASA OCO-  2) can benefit from detailed characterization of the surface.  The data would provide excellent   forest characterization and biomass estimates that can used for science product validation with   any number of missions planned to estimate biomass over large areas (e.g., GEDI, ICESat 2,   BIOMASS, NISAR and their follow-on missions).  The swath approach would also be useful for   missions requiring accurate surface topography including non-vegetated areas such as glaciers,   deserts and coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, mangroves, dunes and tidal flats.    3.   Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?   Terrestrial ecosystems change in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing.  This planet-  wide phenomenon that affects life on Earth from local to global scales and must be measured   repeatedly from space.  Airborne systems can provide excellent calibration and validation   measurements and have been shown to be useful for `filling in` missing data (.e.g., ICEBridge).    Schimel ( 2015) noted that a five- to ten-year cycle of repeat measurements are needed at all   latitudes, and could monitor disturbance and land-use impacts and provide information about the   response of terrestrial biomass to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2.  The proposed   measurements can contribute to information while providing new insights into ecosystem   structure and function.  The measurements discussed herein (high-resolution, multispectral, full   3D structure, well-calibrated image data fused with contiguous samples of high spatial resolution   vegetation structure) are not being produced by current or planned Earth observing sensors.    Commercial high resolution satellite imagery, GEDI lidar and known SAR missions do not   provide coincident, temporal frequency, spectral coverage or consistent resolution necessary to   monitor ecosystem dynamics in the face of climate change.  The measurement suite represents a   sea-change from wall-wall 2-D land attributes mapping to contiguous sampling of the #-D   structure, function and composition of the Earth's biomes.

Accordingly, several national and international conferences and workshops have included extensive community consultation (e.g., university, state, private, non-profits), focused on identifying critical scientific and applicable WF community requirements to advance knowledge to benefit both science and society.  We, as an interconnected WF community, are poised to use space-based observations with complementary aircraft, UAV and ground measurements to address fundamental questions to rapidly advance WF science, applications, operations and decision-support systems to serve science and society. Key Challenges: (I) Ensuring space-based research-quality data essential to WF research, operations and applications collected from current and future satellites is compatible with existing data records.  This includes research-quality algorithms, validated products, science, training and delivery mechanisms.   (II) Given the integral nature of fire and evidence of its intensification and feedbacks, it is essential we develop and maintain space-based instrumentation focused on improving understanding of WF and its connections to the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, climate and society.  This includes developing higher quality and higher spatial/temporal resolution satellite fire products with known accuracy to meet requirements. (III) There is inadequate understanding of WF in the context of baseline conditions in vegetation (species composition/health), fuels (3-D structure/moisture dynamics) and climate (fire weather).  As climate and ecosystems change, identifying vegetation/fuel conditions and understanding the resultant changing fire regimes becomes increasingly complex and necessary.   (IV) Accurate and complete accounting of: available fuel, emissions (smoke/aerosols/trace gases/carbon), injection heights, transport and deposition are critical to understanding fire-mediated feedbacks in the climate system. While interdisciplinary approaches are necessary, action is hindered by disciplinary silos and intense competition for limited resources.   Timeliness:  Intensification of extreme WF behavior threatens the lives and health of responders and citizens and has increased property losses, wildlife habitat loss, and response and recovery cost.  Changes in fire regimes (frequency, extent, intensity, severity, increase in catastrophic events and fire season length) are predicted to be an initial sign of climate change, and fire-climate researchers argue that change is already discernable.    Fire has never been considered an explicit priority in terms of remote observations, even though fire is an integral, consistent and primary link connecting terrestrial, atmospheric, and hydrologic systems to each other and the climate.  WF encompasses numerous interacting and complex physical, ecological, and social factors, a thorough understanding of which is essential to climate, WF science and applications.   Challenge I and II:  In most regions, it is feasible to develop a 35-year satellite-based, continuous vegetation and fire dataset [frequency and/or burned area (BA)], so patterns of fire can be identified, feedbacks to and from the climate system can be quantified (severity, aerosol source, albedo change, pyrogenic carbon on snow/ice, pollution-health), and future fire regimes can be forecast.  Fire-induced ecosystem change is a key climate indicator and without global fire products, this would be impossible.   As one example of the applied use of these data (NIR, SWIR), burn severity is required by BAER teams (Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation) to understand where rapid response is needed to mitigate post-fire hazards (e.g., erosion control/flood management). However, Landsat and MODIS often do not have cloud-free data available in the < 14-days BAER is allotted to make critical decisions.  Rehabilitation is only one of many applied uses of these data.  MODIS coarse-resolution BA products are available to characterize large fires consistently, however, the spatial resolution is inadequate to meet WF applied and operational requirements.  Landsat data are of sufficient spatial resolution, however the repeat frequency is insufficient. The community looks towards Sentinel for augmentation, however Sentinel lacks the SWIR band required to calculate severity. For active fire detection (FD), there are currently 2 operational MODIS (am/pm) instruments that are past their planned lifetimes.  Research-quality VIIRS (pm/launched 2011) FD data will be globally available at a higher resolution soon.  However, there is only one VIIRS instrument, leaving a potential gap in data continuity for applied science users (e.g., EPA National Emission Inventory, WF operations).  There is hope for augmentation with Sentinel active fire (SLSTR), however there is no firm plan to acquire and produce a consistent research-quality product. Pre-launch consideration of research-quality FD/BA products, data continuity and sensor improvement has been and is deficient (dynamic range, on-board aggregation, temporal resolution, research-quality products).  Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is retrievable but complicated by unanticipated differences in spectral response.  FD/BA products will likely become globally available in 2016/2017.   Currently, no improvements to the fire capability of future VIIRS/JPSS instruments are foreseen.  As widely as these BA/FD/severity data are used, both globally and in the US [Universities, Forest Services (fire suppression, identification), NOAA, EPA (emissions inventory, rules and regulatory setting), states, DOI, NPS, FEMA etc.], it is imperative new instruments have design characteristics that make them explicitly consistent with continuous records, and better in key aspects.   Future instruments should be designed and launched to avoid gaps in critical observations and products, however this will only be possible if there is combined community and political will.   Challenge III-IV Vegetation Conditions: Stand dynamics such as species composition, age distribution, and 3-D structure influence fire behavior, and these are not currently well quantified.  As climate changes, ecosystems are likely to become increasingly unhealthy and/or migrate northward or to higher altitudes.  Fire is expected to be a key process driving or facilitating change.   Technology exists to quantify above-ground fuels using active sensors, such as LiDAR and SAR.  These are challenging technologies (processing, storage, pre-processed products and training), however resultant data have the potential for high returns.   Measurement of vegetation health including vegetation stressed by insects, drought, disease, invasive species and legacy management are critical to understanding the amount of fuel that is ‘available’ to burn, and these data are rarely available in the timeframe required.  As a fire burns, it is imperative to know what is burning, however pre-burn stand-structure data are rarely available (e.g., Juniper forest location) and neither is cloud-free 30-m imagery, which is used to determine relative ecosystem health. Detection of smaller (rangeland, agricultural, cropland) and understory fire (peatland, surface, silviculture) becomes possible with increased temporal/spatial resolution. These fires often burn near population centers, where human health is substantially affected, with direct links to increased respiratory illnesses, heart attacks, and death - recently quantified with associated societal and monetary costs.  Specific requirements include increased temporal/spatial resolution (~ 30-meter resolution 2-4 times daily; visible, NIR, SWIR~2.1μm, ~3.9μm, thermal) for pre-fire ecosystem health assessments (fuel availability, vegetation indices), active fire identification and forecast modeling, and post-fire BA and severity assessments for timely rehabilitation, and climate indicator assessments. Any improvement would be helpful (8-day acquisition of Landsat 9).  An enhanced fire product is needed that could benefit multiple science disciplines, similar to FRP with explicit consideration of instrument saturation and realistic fire temperatures. Challenge II-IV: Fire regimes are largely under the control of weather and climate, with anthropogenic landscape alteration often magnifying negative outcomes.  Fuel and soil moisture is critical to estimating fuel availability/loading and fire potential. Antecedent and current fire weather (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity) drives fire intensity and severity, hence fire dynamics, smoke emissions and carbon release.  Weather and climate data are indispensable to: quantifying vegetative fuel moisture (living and dead); duff and soil fuel moisture; initializing active fire forecasts; and forecasting smoke injection and transport, particularly in diverse terrain.  Heat penetration is strongly related to pre-fire vegetation moisture content.  If soil and surface layer fuel moisture is high, temperatures at or below ground are minimal, even in high-fire intensities (translates to severity and depth of fuel burned). Post-fire soil moisture is an essential parameter for modeling post-fire erosion (run-off). The WF community strongly supports improved instrument development that provides high-resolution soil moisture and surface tension, similar to SMAP’s radar.   This community call is also for 3-hourly, 250-500m meteorological data to enhance and simulate: (1) smoke transport (used in prescribed burn Go/No-Go decisions, small- and large-scale Air Quality (AQ) models); (2) state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-wildland fire models that forecast active fire movement and have the realistic potential to save lives; and (3) drive detailed fire weather models that estimate the amount of fuel ‘available’ to burn and potential severity. In support of defining smoke structure in the atmosphere for prescribed burning and large-scale transport for AQ, chemistry and climate, there is a call for product development based on existing lidar profiles (e.g., CALIOP) and/or improved space-based instruments (e.g., HSRL) capable of detecting atmospheric structure to complete feedback loop analyses (e.g., smoke layers, density, clouds).  * Training and applied sciences are strategic to make full societal and applied use of data.  The amount of data is overwhelming.  Users are interested in knowing what information is available, not masses of data, and how to process/use products (gaining applicable knowledge). Space-based observations are fundamental to address essential WF research, science, applications and operations, because large-scale effects can only be described and understood with space-based observations, complemented by other observations (UAVs, ground-based, aircraft). This group strongly and continually links space-based research with other observations to increase value to scientific research and society (human and ecosystem health).   Fire is a critical global process, one that is an integral, consistent and primary link connecting terrestrial, atmospheric, and hydrologic systems to each other and to the climate system, in terms of carbon cycling, biospheric and atmospheric health, and energy exchange.   Fires can produce their own weather; fire emissions immediately alter patterns of precipitation; and post-fire debris flows and landslides pollute and dam waterways.  Major fire-induced emissions and landscape change feedbacks have been largely neglected but are becoming increasingly recognized.  Fire-induced feedbacks are crucial to consider in future climate assessments. Anticipated Scientific and Societal Benefits: Unlike other climate indicators, humankind has the opportunity to moderate, regulate and/or direct WF and related ecosystem change by managing fuels, efficient wildfire suppression and response, ecosystem recovery and landscape management. As climate changes, some environments will no longer be able to sustain the vegetation that previously existed (vegetation-climate envelope), which is a challenging supposition but one that must be considered. Technical capability exists to address key challenges and questions for WF Earth Science.  Key science challenges span Terrestrial Ecology and Atmospheric Chemistry/Dynamics domains, with clear implications for feedbacks to and from regional-global climate.  With relatively minor consideration in instrument design, key WF requirements could also be met to address fundamental WF Science, Applications, Operations and Management challenges.

As magma rises through volcanoes, magmatic processes give rise to changes that can be observed both locally and remotely. Changing magma pressures, driven by magma flow, as well as crystallization and bubble growth, apply forces to the surrounding crust, leading to ground deformation, seismicity, and emissions of gas, ash, and lava from surface vents. These processes are highly non-linear and result in a wide range of volcanic behavior that is difficult to forecast given the limited knowledge of the processes within the volcano interior. However, observations of surface manifestations of the interior processes at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, coupled with physical modeling, provide the potential to forecast eruption behavior. This should significantly improve upon our ability to predict volcano behavior, which – despite the considerable risk to society posed by volcanic eruptions – is currently limited to a largely empirical approach based on pattern recognition from sparse in situ data and previous experience. Figure 1: The high degree of uncertainty of pattern-based forecasting of volcanic behavior during unrest highlights the need to transition into reliable physics-based volcano system understanding and forecasting. (A) The “decision window” confronting public officials after unrest evolves into a volcanic crisis; generally the most likely outcome of escalating volcano unrest is unknown. (B) Some examples of the actual outcomes of heightened unrest at selected volcanoes (diagram and caption from Tilling [2008]).   1. Key questions for volcano science The broad question for volcano science: “How do magmatic systems evolve and under what conditions do volcanoes erupt?” from the “Living on a Restless Planet” report from the Solid Earth Science Working Group (2002), remains relevant and largely unresolved today despite significant progress important components of volcanic systems. The potential with volcanic systems lies in their frequent generation of significant signals prior to eruption (eruption in the broadest possible terms, from “failed” eruptions – intrusions – to long-lasting effusive events). The challenge lies in combining these data into accurate hazard and eruption forecasts (Figure 1; Tilling, 2008). Surface deformation remains one of the key observations for volcano science and monitoring. Over the past 10-15 years increased in-situ geodetic measurements, especially from GPS, along with the ever expanding use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) have led to an increasing appreciation of the spatiotemporal complexity of many magmatic systems [Wicks et al., 1998; 2002; Amelung et al., 2000, 2007; Pritchard and Simons, 2002; Wright et al., 2006; Sigmundsson et al., 2010, 2015; Riel et al., 2015; Lundgren et al., 2013; 2015]. In particular, InSAR has been critical to identifying previously unknown magma intrusions [Wicks et al., 2002; Pritchard and Simons, 2002; Lu et al., 2002] or previously unrecognized deep sources for nearby active volcanoes [Lundgren et al., 2015].  Due to its ability to constrain a number of important properties of volcano mechanical sources, such as shape, location, depth, and volume change, geodesy has thus proven to be an important tool for monitoring and quantifying changes in magmatic systems.  However, geodetic observations poorly constrain the total volume of the magma source (reservoir) , do not provide information on the properties of the magma within, and do not quantify the mass or volatile flux out of the system. Given the great complexity and non-linearity of magma fluid dynamics and volcano mechanics many questions therefore remain, including: · What governs the timing and magnitude of volcanic eruptions? · What determines the onset, duration, and cessation of shallow crustal magma emplacement? · Why do some systems continue to inflate through intermittent eruptive activity while other systems erupt with little precursory activity? Recently, multi-physical (physics-based) time-variable models for volcanoes parameterized by the geometry, rheology, temperature, volatile content, and mass flux of the system have emerged with the potential to both better understand and enable improved prediction of important system parameters such as volume and duration [Anderson and Segall, 2011, 2013; Segall, 2013]. While geodesy is important for constraining the geometry of the system, petrological, gas, gravity, and erupted volume (topography change) observations constrain properties of the magma and the mass balance of the system (Figure 2). The combination of erupted volume and deformation yields magma compressibility, from which we can infer the magma's volatile content -- one of the most important factors controlling eruptive style [Anderson and Segall, 2013].Figure 2. InSAR and repeat topography are critical for observing changes in surface deformation and topography change.

(C) Topography change for the August 2011 lava flow (Kilauea volcano, Hawaii) using TanDEM-X satellite data, which is now reaching the end of its mission [Poland, 2014].    2. Timeliness 2.1 InSAR Recent advances in satellite InSAR, through higher temporal sampling from constellations such as COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, and now Sentinel-1A/B (S1B not yet launched) and future missions such as the NASA NISAR mission will greatly improve the spatial and temporal coverage critical for global geodetic observations at spatiotemporal sampling that will provide critical geodetic constraints on time-varying volcano geometric source parameters. In addition, a number of recent and potential future advances in radar imaging of topography change and magma source locations and volumes, coupled with emerging multispectral remote sensing, are poised to provide additional observations critical to constraining physics-based dynamic source models.  2.2 Topography Topography change observations have been achieved through the German Aerospace Center (DLR) TanDEM-X mission (Figure 2C), but that mission will not be available in the future. A new NASA airborne instrument, GLISTIN, designed for ice and land topography change measurements, flies on the NASA G-III and uses two side-by-side Ka-band radars (1 cm wavelength) to generate single-pass digital elevation models (DEMs). In future volcano crises GLISTIN topography change observations could be used to generate mass flux observations to constrain physics-based models.  2.3 Volume Rayleigh-resonance (RR) radar imaging is a newly emerging method that may allow us to directly image magma reservoirs in the upper crust (~upper 5 km). Though still a theoretical concept, if proven, it has the potential to revolutionize volcano science.  RR imaging uses the scattering of electromagnetic waves in the Rayleigh and resonance regime [Kleinman, 1965; Jackson, 1962], instead of high frequency pulses in sounders, to image magma within volcanic systems at large depths beneath the ground. The Rayleigh region is well known to contain volume information of a scattering body, whereas the resonance region is known to contain shape or area information of a scattering body [Jackson, 1962]. The technique to image using the Rayleigh-resonance scattering has been formulated in the past to enable volume imaging of bodies in free-space or air using a time-domain ramp waveform, instead of a pulse as used in sounders and traditional radars [Young, 1976]. The purpose of the ramp waveform is to emphasize the low-frequency scattering of the body, thus emphasizing the Rayleigh-resonance scattering [Chen and Peters, 2007; Young, 1976]. The low frequency nature of the technique permits much deeper penetration than traditional sounding radars.  3. Need for space- and airborne-based observations Volcanoes span the globe, located in both remote and densely populated locations. To advance volcano science and hazard mitigation requires observations that are global and of uniform quality, although targeted airborne, and in-situ observations at select, high-value locations will also drive scientific progress. This requires remote sensing observations from a trio of radar techniques to provide the required surface deformation, topography change, and reservoir shape and volume: repeat pass InSAR, single pass InSAR, and RR radar imaging.  3.1 Surface deformation Repeat-pass InSAR is the most robust with existing and planned satellite missions from a number of space agencies, including the future NASA NISAR mission. In addition, the NASA UAVSAR L-band airborne instrument can provide surface deformation observations at high resolution from arbitrary viewing geometry and time sampling, thus providing an important complement to satellite InSAR, especially during volcano crises. Due to the wide temporal bandwidth of volcano processes future volcano science will increasingly benefit from higher temporal sampling of surface deformation, especially during major volcano crises, such as exponentially inflating explosive volcanoes and major rifting or diking events.  3.2 Topography change Topography change from single-pass (i.e. tandem) satellite (TanDEM-X) or airborne (NASA GLISTIN) provides all-weather, day-night capabilities to measure topography change. The NASA GLISTIN system could be deployed to measure lava effusion volumes and topography change during both extended volcanic eruptions and shorter duration volcano crises. A new satellite tandem system beyond TanDEM-X is required to provide global access with regular acquisitions, although an airborne system such as GLISTIN would allow for the most frequent and highest resolution observations required during large volcano crises.  3.3 Magma volume imaging  The RR radar technique can be used on an airborne or low-orbiting satellite platform to enable volume imaging of deeply embedded bodies for the following reasons: (1) Scientific observation/imaging of deeply embedded bodies, such as aquifers and magma reservoirs, which cannot be directly observed today, can have sizes, 𝑠, on the order of many hundreds of meters to a few kilometers; (2) The large sizes of these bodies, and due to RR requirements of 𝑠~𝜆 (wavelength), imposes RR radar frequencies on the order of a few hundred kilohertz; (3) The low frequencies required by the RR radar for these bodies penetrate with low loss into conducting ground, which enables remote sensing to substantially lower depths than previously possible with sounding radars; (4) The RR radar technique does not require synthetic aperture radar techniques to perform imaging, and can instead obtain volume imaging from as little as a few looks (three or more looks). When using synthetic aperture, it would be expected to obtain much higher resolution volume images than possible with traditional RR imaging. Validation of this technique will enable a new class of NASA missions that permit science-focused imaging of magma bodies within volcanic systems. In addition, the validation of the technique will also have an impact in potential missions to map aquifers and other large bodies that are located too deeply for traditional sounder technologies. Beyond NASA there are potentially additional benefits for mapping deeply embedded bodies in general, where traditional radio-based techniques fail.   References:  Amelung, F., S. Jonsson, H.

In this paradigm earthquakes respond to anthropogenic and tectonic forcing and to each other and through lithospheric mechanical feedback mechanisms to produce non-steady-state behavior [Dolan et al., 2007; Hetland and Hager, 2006]. Transient stress and strain in the crust and upper mantle are the result of both the interactions of individual earthquakes, which cause coseismic static stress changes [King et al., 1994; Toda and Stein, 2003] followed by postseismic stresses that evolve over varying time scales [Freed and Lin, 2001], and potentially, residual stress changes that evolve over much longer time scales, generating earthquake clustering that is linked in both space and time [Hetland and Hager, 2006; DiCaprio et al., 2008]. Anthropogenic forcing, through processes such as groundwater or petroleum extraction or injection, geothermal energy production [Ali et al., 2015], also cause stress changes on faults leading to observable changes in seismicity [Christiansen et al., 2007; Amos et al., 2014; Mulargia and Bizzarri, 2014; Hornbach et al., 2015]. Advances in this field have resulted from combinations of the seismic record, geologic, and geodetic observations, coupled with numerical models (Figure 1). Our ability to understand and quantify these processes has improved as the spatial and temporal resolutions of surface deformation observations have improved.  1. Key questions for understanding anthropogenic forcing on lithospheric processes Geodetic observations of surface deformation across plate boundaries have been used for more than two decades to constrain distributed tectonics, fault slip rates and fault mechanics, and the rheology of the lithosphere and upper mantle. Geodetic data require specific model assumptions to derive a present-day fault slip rate, with the simplest approach using two-dimensional cross-sectional models of geodetic velocity profiles [Johnson and Segall, 2004; Le Pichon et al., 2005; Fay and Humphreys, 2005; Schmalzle et al., 2006; Fialko, 2006; Johnson et al., 2007; Lundgren et al., 2009]. These models do not typically account for anthropogenic processes that can affect nearby stress changes. The emergence of anthropogenic-lithospheric interaction as an important topic in solid earth science leads to several key questions: 1. What are the spatiotemporal characteristics of anthropogenic and lithospheric processes? 2. How do anthropogenic processes affect geodetic estimates of fault mechanics?  3. What is the long-term and transient fault mechanical behavior along the locked and creeping portions of faults in light of anthropogenic forcing?  To address these questions requires combining advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and GPS time series analysis with in situ observations of fluid extraction/injection to constrain numerical deformation models, computing fault stress changes, earthquake cycle slip rates, postseismic deformation, and time variations in seismicity. These processes are of global relevance, with California an ideal location for studying the spatiotemporal effects of long-term, seasonal, and intermittent forcing due to water and petroleum extraction, injection, and seasonal hydrological recharge.

A detail of the aquifer (white box in (b)) is shown in (c). (d) A profile of the surface deformation.   2. Timeliness 2.1 InSAR Recent advances in satellite InSAR, through higher temporal sampling from satellite constellations such as the X-band Italian COSMO-SkyMed, the German TerraSAR-X, C-band European Sentinel-1A/B (S1B not yet launched), L-band SAR missions such as the current Japanese ALOS-2, and the future Argentine SAOCOM tandem and NASA NISAR missions will greatly improve the spatial and temporal coverage critical for global geodetic observations at spatiotemporal sampling that will provide critical geodetic constraints on time-varying anthropogenic processes.  Although geodesy has the ability to track spatial and temporal patterns of deformation from anthropogenic processes, it generally lacks resolution of the depth and volume of subsurface reservoirs.   2.2 Volume Rayleigh-resonance (RR) radar imaging is a newly emerging method that may allow us to directly image magma and other fluid reservoirs in the upper crust (~upper 5 km). Though still a theoretical concept, if proven, it has the potential to provide direct observations of the principal volumes associated with anthropogenic processes. Combined with surface deformation, gravity mass change estimates, and in-situ well data, it can improve constraints on numerical models of anthropogenic effects on lithospheric processes. RR imaging uses the scattering of electromagnetic waves in the Rayleigh and resonance regime [Kleinman, 1965; Jackson, 1962], instead of high frequency pulses in sounders, to image magma within volcanic systems at large depths beneath the ground. The Rayleigh region is well known to contain volume information of a scattering body, whereas the resonance region is known to contain shape or area information of a scattering body [Jackson, 1962]. The technique to image using the Rayleigh-resonance scattering has been formulated in the past to enable volume imaging of bodies in free-space or air using a time-domain ramp waveform, instead of a pulse as used in sounders and traditional radars [Young, 1976]. The purpose of the ramp waveform is to emphasize the low-frequency scattering of the body, thus emphasizing the Rayleigh-resonance scattering [Chen and Peters, 2007; Young, 1976]. The low frequency nature of the technique permits much deeper penetration than traditional sounding radars.  3. Need for space-based observations Anthropogenic processes are global phenomena, often located in tectonically active, densely populated regions. To understand how anthropogenic processes, how they are mixed with tectonic signals, and how they interact with tectonic processes requires observations that are global and of uniform quality, that combined with in-situ observations and numerical models will drive scientific progress and improve hazard assessments of both tectonic and anthropogenic processes. This requires remote sensing observations from two radar techniques, gravity, and in-situ well water and pumping data to provide the required surface deformation, reservoir shape and volume: repeat pass InSAR, RR radar imaging, and satellite gravity.  3.1 Surface deformation The foundational nature of geodesy to measure surface deformation from long-term and transient deformation sources will continue to play a primary role in understanding anthropogenic and lithospheric processes. These observations from GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) will continue and improve when the new high-coherence, dense temporal sampling NISAR mission is launched. Though relatively mature, satellite InSAR often suffers from decorrelation in vegetated or agricultural regions, and new methods employing persistent scatterers or other advance InSAR time series analysis methods in combination with in-situ data are improving InSAR analysis of anthropogenic processes [Miller and Shirzaei, 2015].  3.2 Reservoir imaging  The RR radar technique can be used on an airborne or low orbiting satellite platform to enable volume imaging of deeply embedded bodies for the following reasons: (1) Scientific observation/imaging of deeply embedded bodies, such as aquifers and magma reservoirs, which cannot be directly observed today, can have sizes, 𝑠, on the order of many hundreds of meters to a few kilometers; (2) The large sizes of these bodies, and due to RR requirements of 𝑠~𝜆 (wavelength), imposes RR radar frequencies on the order of a few hundred kilohertz; (3) The low frequencies required by the RR radar for these bodies penetrate with low loss into conducting ground, which enables remote sensing to substantially lower depths than previously possible with sounding radars; (4) The RR radar technique does not require synthetic aperture radar techniques to perform imaging, and can instead obtain volume imaging from as little as a few looks (three or more looks). When using synthetic aperture, it would be expected to obtain much higher resolution volume images than possible with traditional RR imaging. Validation of this technique will enable a new class of NASA missions that permit science-focused imaging of reservoir systems, with an impact on potential missions to map aquifers and other large bodies that are located too deep for traditional sounder technologies. Beyond NASA there are potentially additional benefits for mapping deeply embedded bodies in general, where traditional radio-based techniques fail.  3.3 Gravity In order to understand anthropogenic mass changes over large spatial scales gravity data from GRACE and the future GRACE Follow-on missions will be important, along with in-situ well observations. The ability to resolve mass changes at finer spatial scales is important for constraining mass changes at smaller reservoir (down to 10’s of km), but over the next decade mass changes will likely rely on models that relate GRACE data and surface deformation to estimate water storage variations [Argus et al., 2014; Fu et al, 2015].

Timely implementation of CLARREO will provide   the reference inter-calibration needed to substantiate long-term trends.      White Paper Description (1500 character limit):       1. The Long-term Challenge of Detecting Unambiguous Trends in Stratospheric Temperature     Despite its importance for radiation budget, dynamics and chemistry, the rate and vertical structure of   stratospheric temperature change remains poorly constrained (Stocker et al. 2013). Many stratospheric   trace gas species, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and water vapor, affect the radiation energy balance by   interacting with the shortwave solar radiation and the longwave terrestrial radiation. Numerical   experiments show that stratospheric contributions are critical for the climate system to maintain the   balance of the top-of-the atmosphere radiation energy budget during transient climate change. For   example, the magnitude of the overall time-varying stratospheric effect on the outgoing longwave   radiation can be comparable to that of the overall longwave cloud feedback, and the intermodal spread is   as large as that of the overall non-cloud tropospheric feedback (Huang 2013).       To highlight the importance and challenges related to stratospheric trend detection we quote from recent   literature:     Temperature trends in the stratosphere are an important component of global change. These trends can provide evidence of the   roles of natural and anthropogenic climate change mechanisms; the ‘‘fingerprint’’ of distinct tropospheric warming and   stratospheric cooling provides information on the effects of these mechanisms. (Randel et al. 2009)   Atmospheric temperature trends through the depth of the atmosphere offer the possibility of separating the effects of multiple   climate forcings, as climate model simulations indicate that each external forcing produces a different characteristic vertical and   zonal pattern of temperature response. GHG forcing is expected to warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. Stratospheric   ozone depletion cools the stratosphere, with the cooling being most pronounced in the polar regions.  (Bindoff et al. IPCC 2013)   There is increasing agreement between various datasets over temperature change for the bulk of the troposphere and lower   stratosphere, but appreciable uncertainty remains as to rates of change and variations with height. The upper stratosphere is more   problematic still, as reliance has to be placed on satellite data alone for global monitoring, and instrumental changes make it   difficult to construct a coherent record for the whole of the satellite era. (Simmons et al. 2014)            a. Summary of Current Satellite Capabilities    The U.S. POESS program built a series of infrared sensors called the Stratospheric Sounding   Unit (SSU) for flight on the NOAA series of sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites starting in   1979. These instruments used a broadband infrared detector, which viewed the atmosphere   through a pressured gas cell containing CO2. Unfortunately the CO2 gas cells tended to leak,   which caused the vertical peak for sensor response to change with time. This error combined   with calibration differences among the seven SSU sensors, has caused spurious trends in upper   stratospheric temperature, which are still being actively studied at NOAA NESDIS. Despite   these issues a general cooling trend was observed from 1979 to 2005. Near the end of the SSU   series, the passive microwave AMSU-A sensor was added to the NOAA satellite series with   channels that peak in the lower, middle, and upper stratosphere similar to the SSU sensor.   AMSU-A uses oxygen absorption bands/lines for atmospheric temperature sounding. A recent   paper by Simmons et al. (2014) showed that when the ERA-Interim data assimilation switched   from using SSU to AMSU-A in 1999, it introduced a discontinuity of 5 degrees (!) in the   temperature time series at 1 hPa. This makes the use of ERA-Interim for trend detection   problematic. No doubt the AMSU-A is a great improvement on the SSU with respect to stability.   However, the absolute calibration of the AMSU-A sensor is less well understood. As quoted   previously, Simmons et al. (2014) has identified the middle and upper stratosphere as a   problematic region for construction of a coherent temperature record from existing conventional   radiosonde and satellite data.    One of the recent additions to the space based observing system is the active GPS radio   occultation (RO) measurement from the joint U.S./Taiwan COSMIC program. COSMIC is   composed of NASA JPL designed radio receivers on a Taiwanese satellite constellation of six   satellites measuring phase delays due to atmospheric bending of pulses emitted by the Global   Positioning Satellite network. COSMIC has been producing global daily meteorological products   since 2007. Almost immediately the GPS RO bending angles were adopted for inclusion in   ECMWF data assimilation and treated as an anchor dataset, although only in a limited height   region covering the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. However, in altitudes above 30   hPa both the random and systematic error of the COSMIC and GRAS RO temperature   information increases with height (Steiner et al. 2013). This currently limits the use of GPS RO   to monitoring of the lower stratosphere where it complements the existing radiosonde   observations by providing more uniform global spatial coverage. There is a need for a reference   GPS RO measurement that extends the useful accuracy to the middle and upper stratosphere.   Spectrally resolved infrared spectra of the Earth (often referred to as hyperspectral infrared) were   first collected in the 1970s. However, routine global hyperspectral infrared observations only   began with the NASA AIRS sensor on the Aqua platform in September 2002 as input into   operational numerical weather prediction models (NWP). AIRS has operated for more than 13   years collecting top of atmosphere infrared spectra with good radiometric accuracy. Narrow   spectral channels near the 667.7 cm -1   CO2 Q-branch peak in the middle and upper stratosphere.   Pan et al. (2015) have recently shown that analysis of the AIRS high peaking channels gives a   statistically significant cooling trend that increases with height in the stratosphere over the period   2003–2012. This is in apparent conflict with the AMSU-A oxygen channels observed during the  same time period. The operational follow-on to the NASA AIRS sensor is the NOAA Cross-  track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) currently operating on the Suomi-NPP satellite. While the AIRS     results are intriguing, they justify the need for an on-orbit infrared calibration reference that can   be used to tie operational satellites to international standards over the next several decades.    Inter-calibration of operational sensors is an element of the Climate Absolute Radiance and   Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission that was chosen as one of four Tier 1 missions in   the 2007 Decadal Survey. Highlights include emission spectra that include the same stratospheric   channels used by the operational infrared sounders, but using new technologies specifically   developed under NASA Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) efforts to verify expected accuracy   on-orbit. The CLARREO mission includes a reference GPS radio-occultation receiver to provide   bending angle measurements that are expected to improve the understanding of the ionospheric   corrections used in analysis of existing GPS RO observations. The authors recommend that the   CLARREO mission be flown as an observatory or as separate flight elements depending on cost   and schedule constraints. Details are available in Wielicki et al BAMS 2014.   b. Linking space-based observations with other observations   Interpretation of infrared radiance in the carbon dioxide bands at 15 and 4.3 microns requires   estimates of CO2 profiles such as from the NOAA Carbon Tracker program. Moreover, the   infrared hyperspectral radiance and RO data will be used in conjunction with the GRUAN   reference radiosonde and ozone-sonde network to provide global reference validation data.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits   A changing Brewer-Dobson circulation has a significant role in the dynamical coupling between the   stratosphere and troposphere with implications for surface climate and weather (Butchart 2014). The   Value of Information for the proposed space-borne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne   systems ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars (Cooke et al. 2013).   d. The science communities that would be involved.    The NWP forecast, NWP re-analysis, Global Climate Model, and middle atmospheres   composition communities will be involved.   2. Time to start a coherent record of stratospheric temperature change.   We are midway through the second decade of the 21 st  century and yet the science of decadal   climate change requires accuracies significantly higher than current systems (Wielicki et al.   BAMS 2014). A timely execution of the CLARREO mission will overlap with the operational   JPSS series and METOP series to provide inter-calibration for programs that will last through   2040 and backward in time through 2003.   3. Space-based observations are indispensable.    The existing radiosonde network has adequate vertical resolution but does not routinely make   global observations above (30 hPa) to characterize the middle and upper stratosphere (Seidel et   al. 2011). Only global satellite observations have sufficient time and space sampling to   characterize long-term zonal temperature trends in the stratosphere.

Johnson1, A. Coletti2, P. Mulligan3, B. Diedrich4, C. McInnis5   1 NASA Marshall Space Flight Center  2 Syneren Technologies Corporation  3 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (retired)  4 Independent contractor  5 University of Glasgow      Abstract   Solar sails are being developed by NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Union, and   private space organizations to enable new space science and exploration missions. This new technology can be used   to create Artificial Lagrange Orbits above the earth’s Polar Regions to provide continuous full-disk monitoring from  a unique vantage point.   ALO’s ADDRESS KEY CHALLENGES FOR EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE  The community requires continuous full-disk, polar-centered measurements of the earth to monitor the polar   ice caps and gain a continuous synoptic view of the interaction between large weather systems in the Polar Regions   and those in the mid latitudes. Such polar-centered measurements are needed to complete the whole system picture   of our planet without partitions and improve understanding of the interactions along zonal and vertical boundaries.   These measurements would enable the benefits of current geostationary satellite orbits, including rapid scan   operations, feature tracking, and atmospheric motion vectors (or cloud drift winds), which are currently enjoyed   only by satellite orbits in the middle and tropical latitudes. Including UV light (340 and 388 nm), visible light, and   NIR channels (>1 micron) in these observations would allow the study of ice features and ice/cloud discrimination.   These channels would also enable monitoring of Antarctic ice margins and ozone measurements, including the use   of ozone observations to map out high altitude (20 km) winds where most of the interactions between the   stratosphere and troposphere tend to occur.   To make these measurements, the observing platform needs to be elevated out of the plane of Earth’s orbit  (ecliptic) in Artificial Lagrange Orbits (ALOs). Maintaining these orbits requires advanced propulsion with low   thrust and high efficiency for the very large delta-v needed. Solar sails are the most efficient long-term solution to   this problem [1, 2].   TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO ENABLE ALOs ARE RAPIDLY MATURING   Two recent developments reinforce the timeliness and advantages of continuous full-polar hemispheric remote   sensing. The DSCOVR mission, launched in February 2015, entered orbit around the first Lagrange point between   the sun and Earth in June of 2015. Project science teams are analyzing DSCOVR’s 10-channel earth imagery and  radiation budget measurements. Science results will begin to be available over the next year. These measurements   will provide supporting evidence for the advantages of the full-disk monitoring approach, albeit with the disk   centered on the equator instead of the poles.   NASA is developing the propulsion technology (solar sails) to enable these orbits with the planned flight of   Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout) mission in 2018 [3]. This technology is strongly supported in the White   House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Strategic and Action Plans released on October 28th (see   Goal 5 of Space Weather Action Plan) [4].   ALOs are needed to increase the warning time for geomagnetic storms by placing the space platform closer to   the sun than L1, where these measurements are currently taken. Although these plans are directed toward improving   space weather observations, the basic technology and performance level can support the out-of-plane orbits   discussed in this paper. The earth science community should strongly support near-term development and testing of   this technology. To achieve this end, partnerships should be sought with other interested communities, including          2      NASA, the Heliophysics community, NOAA, the USAF, and international partners.   WHY SPACE-BASED OBSERVATIONS?   Continuous monitoring of large-scale (regional) features cannot be accomplished from the ground. Unlike any   other observational platform, ALOs enable a unique monitoring of the radiative balance of both the diurnal and   seasonal cycles under quasi-stationary – or at least slowly varying – illumination-observation angles. This will be a  tremendous advantage for improving detailed definitions of surface features, e.g., Bidirectional Reflectance   Distribution Function (BRDF), essential for correct interpretation of trends in land use, deforestation, and   afforestation. Observation of the surface during entire daily cycles provides the information necessary to separate   different effects due to shadows, surface types, and land use. This is extremely important for planners and managers   to evaluate and compare local experiences against high resolution earth resources observations from low Earth   orbits (LEOs).   Another advantage ALOs offer is continuously monitoring Polar Region transport and deposition processes of   pollutants, carbon particles from forest fires, and volcanic explosive events. Soot and organic carbon depositions   are a key factor in the thinning of the ice caps. Melting ice affects ocean thermohaline circulation with consequences   on fisheries and related human activities.   Basic science progress will accelerate with direct access to large-scale phenomena suitable for framing issues   and validating calibration of other environmental observations. It will be possible to place local-scale observations   of weather and environmental parameter changes in the larger context of regional studies. Likewise, limited   temporal studies will benefit from the long-term observations taken by instruments on platforms that are subject to   minimal thermal fluctuations and possess better long-term stability. Ultimately, both climate science and weather   predictions will benefit from accessing global views of the Polar Regions at high refresh rate with a minimal   processing overhead.   SOLAR SAILS   Solar sail propulsion uses sunlight to propel vehicles through space by reflecting solar photons from a large   mirror-like sail made of a lightweight, highly reflective material. The continuous photonic pressure provides   propellantless thrust to perform a wide range of advanced maneuvers, such as hovering indefinitely at points in   space or conducting orbital plane changes more efficiently than conventional chemical propulsion.    Practical concepts for solar sailing have existed for approximately 100 years, beginning with Tsiolkovsky and   Tsander in the 1920s. A team at JPL completed the first serious mission study in the late 1970s for a rendezvous   with Halley’s Comet [5]. An effort by McInnes in the 1990s and the publication of his PhD dissertation as a textbook  on solar sailing helped reinvigorate interest in solar sailing as a research topic [1]. In the early to mid 2000’s, NASA’s  In-Space Propulsion Technology Project made substantial progress in the development of solar sail propulsion   systems. Engineers produced and successfully tested two different 20 m solar sail systems in the Glenn Research   Center’s (GRC’s) Space Power Facility at Plum Brook Station, Ohio [6].   Outside of NASA, solar sailing has been tested in space. In the summer of 2010, the Japanese Aerospace   Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched a solar sail spacecraft named IKAROS in tandem with another mission to   Venus. The sailcraft IKAROS (14 m2) is the first in-ﬂight demonstration of solar sailing [7]. Figure 1 is a photograph  of the IKAROS spacecraft and deployed solar sail in interplanetary space. While the effects of solar radiation   pressure (SRP) are smaller on this sailcraft as compared to other concepts for solar sails, the design achieved   numerous program objectives, including verifying SRP effects on the sail and performing in-flight guidance and   navigation techniques. The University of Surrey is developing multiple CubeSat-class solar and drag sail spacecraft,   including CubeSail, DeorbitSail, and InflateSail. Each will have a total mass of around 3 kg and will deploy 16 m2   sails in LEO.          3        Figure 1.  The Japanese flew the IKAROS 196 m2 solar sail into interplanetary space in 2010, demonstrating   the technology for future mission implementation. (Image courtesy of JAXA.)      The NEA Scout mission, managed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), will use an 86 m2 sail   as primary propulsion while surveying and imaging one or more NEAs of interest for possible future human   exploration. Manifested for flight in 2018, NEA Scout will be NASA’s first interplanetary solar sail mission. The  Planetary Society's Lightsail-A (5.65 m2), flew successfully in Earth orbit in the spring of 2015. LightSail-B is   manifested for launch in the fall of 2016.   Due to the continuous force provided by solar radiation pressure on a solar sail, solar sail spacecraft can fly in   non-Keplerian orbits, such as ALOs, and can continually maneuver throughout flight without the use of finite   propellant – providing a long-term capability for sustained scientific observations of Earth’s Polar Regions.

Synoptic, long-term observations from space, integrated   successfully with in situ and human observations, are a key component of an effective   monitoring strategy.    Advanced marine ecosystem science, supported by high-quality and reliable observations, is   needed to inform policy and management decisions that promote healthy, productive, diverse,   and sustainable ecosystems. Scientists must determine the status, trends, and future states of   these ecosystems and their populations; understand physical, chemical, and biological drivers,   mechanisms, and processes and impacts; assess the vulnerability of ecosystems to current and   emerging human activities and climate and environmental changes; and inform effective and   robust management strategies. This requires an increase in the collection and use of high-quality   environmental data, at appropriate temporal and spatial scales, to describe and understand these   ecosystems and improve regional forecasts and projections. The purpose of this White Paper is   to highlight the key research questions and challenges facing marine ecosystem science,   particularly in the context of informing Federal resource management, and outline the   observational requirements necessary to support this science over the next decade.      1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum   of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming   decade?    Marine ecosystem science and management face many challenges, requiring basic and applied   research supported by ongoing, quality observations. This paper focuses on four key questions,   based on the NOAA 5-year R&D Plan 1 , that incorporate a number of important challenges and   benefit from sustained and new observing systems and technologies to measure and monitor   marine ecosystems from space and in situ platforms.                                                                     1 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Research and Development at NOAA: Five   Year Research and Development Plan 2013-2017, 78pp.        What is the value of marine ecosystems?   In addition to their direct economic benefits, marine ecosystems provide vital life support   functions and recreational opportunities, sustain wildlife habitats, and reduce environmental and   human health risks. Quantitative valuation of these ecosystem services is difficult and too easily   discounted in policy decisions. Better valuation requires identifying and monitoring key   ecosystem attributes, processes, and exchanges. It also requires better methods to measure   ecosystem production, assess marine populations, monitor habitat protection and restoration   efforts, and quantify coastal habitat benefits. Advancing and implementing new observing and   analysis techniques will result in more accurate information on the comprehensive value that   ecosystems provide.        How do environmental changes affect marine ecosystems and the economic and ecological   services they provide?   A better understanding of how marine ecosystems are affected by climate and environmental   change and human activities will enable more robust assessments and forecasts, leading to   improved management that promotes sustainable, healthy, and productive ecosystems. Scientists   need to identify, understand, monitor, and forecast changes in ecologically critical watershed,   coastal, and open ocean habitats, their populations, and the drivers that shape them; and   document commercial and recreational activities, their interactions, and effects on marine   populations and habitats. Observing and tracking changes in the environment and human   activities in Polar regions are particularly important.       What exists in the unexplored areas of our oceans?   The ocean remains largely unexplored. Satellite observations are critical to mapping and   characterizing remote and unexplored ocean areas, particularly in the US EEZ and Extended   EEZ. From satellite observations and the development of new technologies to observe and   describe these regions, scientists can acquire new knowledge and share it with operational users   and partners in ocean exploration, research, and management.        How can emerging observational technologies improve ecosystem-based management?   Effective ecosystem-based management requires a synthesis of scientific information from   relevant physical, chemical, ecological, and human processes in relation to specified   management objectives. Innovative technologies to improve remote sensing and alternative in   situ platforms are needed to provide more accurate and precise synoptic information of key     marine populations and environmental influences on their production, distribution, and health;   and to improve abundance estimates, regional assessments and forecasts, and address measure   uncertainty.       2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to   readiness?    The interdependence of ecosystems and economies makes coastal communities vulnerable to   chronic – and potentially catastrophic – natural and human-induced hazards, including oil spills,   toxins, plastics, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, pathogen outbreaks, unsafe seafood, changes in   streamflow, and severe weather. Demands for seafood, energy, recreation, and other pressures   will continue to stress ecosystem health and sustainability. Reduced fish stocks, illegal fishing,   and declines of iconic species result in lost opportunities for employment, economic growth, and   recreation. Climate change and ocean acidification alters nearshore and open ocean habitats,   which subsequently affects recreational, economic, and conservation activities.    The demand exists – and is growing - for better observations and science for effective   community planning, resource management, and business decisions, and to help spur private and   business innovation in marine sectors. At a time when environmental conditions are changing at   an increasing rate, our capability to collect and incorporate environmental data into operational   marine resource assessments, forecast models, and decision-making processes must be improved.   A critical limitation to progress in these areas is high-quality, long-term climate data records, a   majority of which require satellite data with higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution than   currently exists. NOAA and NASA are both working to ensure these capabilities will continue   into the future, but we are increasingly relying on international partners for the continuity of   satellite data streams.       3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these   challenges/questions?    Satellite observations have revolutionized how we see and understand the ocean. They provide   context for connecting global synoptic variability to regional information and decision making,   and demonstrate air-sea-ice interactions on multiple spatial and temporal scales that must be   considered when addressing ecosystem condition. They reveal that managing a resource requires   incorporating data from far beyond regional boundaries to understand the full range of pressures   and risks to that resource. Space-based observations are instrumental in understanding and   forecasting climate change and reducing its effects, exploring and characterizing remote areas,   providing for the sustainable use and enjoyment of marine resources, improving human and   marine environmental health, protecting lives and property from hazards, and enhancing     economic vigor, quality of life, maritime safety, and national security. Their products serve   multiple users and purposes, resulting in great return on the investment in R&D and operational   observing infrastructure.   Federal agencies are moving toward fully integrated ecosystem science and ecosystem-based   management of marine resources and activities. This has given new impetus for better   monitoring and understanding of the environmental factors influencing fish stock and protected   species, and for including environmental variability as an integral part of the ecosystem   assessment process. Most of the spatial features that characterize ecosystems and their variability   (i.e., ocean fronts, eddies, convergence zones, river plumes) cannot be resolved adequately   without the repeating synoptic view satellite data provide.   The future success of ecosystem-based management, and the science that supports it, will depend   on a diverse and complex set of interconnected information sources, hardware, and data and   model developers. Data from NOAA and partner satellites, combined with in situ ocean   observing systems, are a critical foundation. Much of the data used in marine research are   collected by systems dedicated to regular operations (e.g., the Geostationary Operational   Environmental Satellite constellation). Other data needs are unique to marine ecosystem   research. We need more high-quality, synoptic, and regular environmental data to describe,   understand, and forecast ocean changes and their ecosystem impacts, and to develop and apply   analytical models and tools to increase our knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms and   impacts of environmental changes on marine resources and ecosystems.    R&D in support of observing systems must focus on what needs to be measured to support   agency operational and research mission goals. Much of this focus is on how to effectively and   efficiently make new types of observations, variables, and products, as well as how to improve   the accuracy, coverage, resolution, effectiveness, and cost of measuring existing parameters. The   Federal space-based observing system portfolio needs to balance growing demands for data with   concerns about maintaining existing systems and implementing emerging technologies.   Escalating costs to support existing and emerging observations require rigorous analysis and   determination of the most effective observing portfolio.   Satellites are part of the global integrated ocean observing network, which provides real-time   data and a growing archive of information about marine ecosystems. We stress that space-based   observations alone are insufficient to address the challenges faced in marine ecosystem   science. Integrated earth systems models, for example, require data derived from a broad   spectrum of satellite, in situ, and human observations. However, satellites are an essential   component of the observing and monitoring systems that science and management need, and that   the Nation must continue to supply.

Specific objectives should aim to:  represent emerging belowground understanding in models; evaluate the resulting simulations  with global-scale observations; and build confidence in greenhouse gas budgets and  projections.    1   Key challenges for Earth System Science in the coming decade:    Advancing our understanding and representation of belowground processes in the face of  environmental change is a key challenge facing Earth System Science. Addressing this  challenge requires mechanistic insight be applied in process-based models that are validated  with large-scale and space-based observations. Although remote sensing platforms currently  have limited capabilities to directly observe belowground processes, they can observe large-  scale state factors that influence subsurface activity (e.g., climate, topography, vegetation, and  land use) and the emergent properties of those drivers on belowground processes (e.g.,  production of greenhouse gasses) (Fig. 1). Thus, over the next decade we need financial and  intellectual commitments to link process-based understanding with models and large-scale  observations in order to assess regional and global biogeochemical responses on a changing  planet.   Despite advancements in conceptual and numerical representations of climate system, there  remains considerable uncertainty and very low confidence in the projected magnitude and sign  of terrestrial carbon (C) cycle–climate feedbacks1-5. Improving confidence in projected  feedbacks is critical to inform decisions regarding allowable carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that  are compatible with particular climate trajectories6,7. High uncertainty in terrestrial  biogeochemical projections reflects the incomplete understanding of how best to represent  biologically driven processes at global scales8,9. The theoretical underpinnings and C stocks  simulated in Earth System Models (ESMs) are notably poor10,11. These shortcomings that have  direct impacts on projections of atmospheric CO2 and climate. They must be addressed with  empirical research that improves our mechanistic understanding of terrestrial processes, which  is translated into the next generation of models that are parameterized, and validated with  appropriate large-scale data sets. These advancements especially needed in the representation  of soils – the largest terrestrial C pool on Earth – which provide a multitude of ecosystem  services critical to supporting life on our planet12.       Fig. 1 | Controls over soil biogeochemical processes at various spatial scales. At fine scales  (nm, µm, and m), biological and soil physiochemical factors control soil biogeochemical  processes. At larger scales (> m), factors like relief and climate interact with fine scale factors to  mediate soil biogeochemical dynamics and responses to perturbations. Data are needed across  scales and disciplines to improve our understanding and projections of ecosystem responses to  change (e.g., soil C response to warming; modified from ref. 13).    2   Addressing these challenges:   Models generally use broad-scale variation in factors such as plant communities, land use, and  vegetation to predict soil-atmosphere exchange of C. However, empirical and theoretical  advances emphasize that soil C cycling is strongly regulated by microbial communities and their  interactions with minerals14-17. Microbes are not just decomposers, but are also the proximate  source of organic matter that persists in soils. Indeed, other known controls of C cycling,  including those represented in most models, may serve primarily as indirect controls over C  cycling through their effects on microbe-mineral interactions. Models based on these new  theories show that explicitly considering microbial soil organic matter formation improves  steady-state estimates of global soil C stocks and, more importantly, changes the magnitude of  projected terrestrial C storage responses to global environmental change 18-22.   Developing the models that link theory and observations across multiple scales remains limited  because: (a) we do not have the requisite empirical data and understanding to represent the  mechanisms we think are important; (b) we lack relationships that allow us to use remotely- sensed data over large scales to estimate ecosystem function, and link these processes to  mechanisms; and (c) we are unsure what key biotic and abiotic processes are necessary to  represent in global-scale models. By putting soil microbes into models we are beginning to  represent critical organisms that directly control soil C cycling, but to do this effectively we need  to better understand microbial physiological traits and how they affect biogeochemical dynamics  in soils.   Observations provided by new technologies and experimental approaches are rapidly  expanding the spatial and temporal scales over which measurements are made. Such     advancements reshape and refine the understanding of belowground processes23 and provide  an opportunity to meet fundamental scientific challenges. However, linking insight provided by  these disparate data streams, which span orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal scale, to  the global C cycle is needed to address societally and policy relevant issues over the next  decade. To address this challenge we need a greater investment, integration and  communication among empiricists and modelers. These collaborations should cross disciplinary  boundaries (from biology, geology, atmospheric science, and remote sensing) to apply theory,  generate hypotheses, collect data, and refine understanding through an iterative exchange of  ideas and information.     This area of research should aim to improve confidence in belowground projections by  identifying and representing key mechanisms such as microbial activity and physicochemical  stabilization of soil organic matter under different environmental conditions. We suggest  focusing in the near-term on improving confidence in model projections, as opposed to reducing  uncertainty, because with better process-based representation, we can be confident that gains  in certainty are actually meaningful.   3   Space-based observations are fundamental to addressing these challenges:   We may not be able to see soil microbes from space, but we can observe state factors that  drive soil processes at larger scales (Fig. 1). By linking mechanistic insight into soil microbial- mineral interactions with the next generation of process-based ESMs and space-based  observations we expect to:   1. Represent emerging belowground understanding in models;  2. Evaluate the resulting biogeochemical simulations from the top-down; and  3. Increase confidence in greenhouse gas budgets and projections.   Space-based observations will be critical for linking mechanistic understanding with advanced  models to improve confidence in the representation of biogeochemical processes and  projections.     Earth system models must represent emerging understanding of belowground processes. This  can be accomplished by linking microbial traits with broad-scale variation in state factors.  Space-based observations have exceptional potential to inform scaling relationships between  local measurements and global models. Remote sensing is now used to: classify soil type24,25;  monitor changes in vegetation over time (e.g., Landsat and MODIS); and provide real time  information on the seasonal cycle, interannual variability, and effects of extreme events on  global climate and surface soil moisture conditions (e.g., GCOM-W1 and SMAP). These global  measurements should be paired with rigorous point based quantification of microbial  physiological traits, soil C, and their responses to state factors. With proper investment and  engagement we can reach the point where linking broad differences in state factors with  functional variation in microbial communities and activity is achievable. Space-based  observations can provide data that are fundamental to upscaling local observations to regional  and global scales, and this information can then be used to inform the structure and  parameterization of ESMs.   Space-based data will also be critical to evaluating simulated greenhouse gas fluxes from the  next generation of ESMs. Previously, ground-based observations from eddy-flux tower  measurements were used to evaluate fluxes of C, energy and water from ESMs26-28. With  increasing fidelity, however, observation platforms provide excellent top-down constraints on the  concentration and distribution of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere (e.g., OCO-2, GOSAT,     and TCCON). The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) provides globally gridded  information with high temporal resolution that can be used to inform, parameterize, and evaluate  ESMs. With high enough spatial and temporal measurements, an inverse modeling approach  could suggest places/biomes we need to understand better. Specifically, we envision this  satellite-based data will provide top-down constraints on the location, magnitude and timing of  terrestrial greenhouse gas fluxes, and that these data will be critical to develop and validate the  next generation of ESMs.    We expect to increase confidence in model projections by simultaneously improving the small- scale process representation and large-scale patterns of greenhouse gas budgets and fluxes.  This objective points to the interplay between ESMs and spaced-based data, whereby process- based models are used to interpret satellite observations as we monitor planetary change from  above. For example, surface CO2 measurements show the amplitude of the Northern  Hemisphere seasonal CO2 cycle is increasing29, but offer relatively little insight into the  mechanisms responsible for this observation. Although several hypotheses exist for contributors  to this29-31, the spatial and temporal resolution provided by satellites like OCO-2 and Soil  Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) will provide greater insight into the timing and location of  systems that may be responsible for this observation. Interpreting these space-based  observations with ESMs that are based on the theoretical underpinnings described above will  increase the value of satellite data, and concurrently improve the accuracy and confidence in  model simulations.  A key test of ESMs will be reproducing both the current day seasonal CO2  cycle magnitude and its change over the past 60 years, and getting soil processes right will be  an important step to achieving this.   Earth system models provide a powerful tool for merging insights provided from field- and lab- based observations with space-based data products in ways that will provide a deeper  understanding of the factors regulating soil biogeochemical processes across scales.  Developing these capacities is critical to advance basic and applied research in soil, agricultural,  ecosystem, and Earth System Science. Building these interdisciplinary connections will expand  scientific opportunities and address societal needs to more accurately project belowground  responses and feedbacks to environmental perturbations.

Cooper  Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder   Chemical Sciences Division, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Boulder      A White Paper in response to the Initial Request for Information (RFI) from the National   Research Council 2017 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space           1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic   research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade?      The 2014 NASA workshop on Outstanding Questions in Atmospheric Composition (Final report:   https://espo.nasa.gov/home/content/NASA_SMD_Workshop) identified several questions of critical   importance for improving our understanding of present-day and future ozone air quality:       What are the major pollution sources in the developing world and how can we   improve projections of future air quality and global composition?   How is tropospheric ozone changing globally and regionally, and what drives these   long-term trends?    What controls background ozone concentrations in surface air?   These questions are particularly germane to western North America, a region impacted by the import of   background ozone which is strongly influenced by ozone precursor emissions from South and east Asia.    Background ozone refers to the ozone that would exist in the absence of any anthropogenic ozone   precursor emissions from North America; a quantity that cannot be measured by instruments, but must   instead be calculated by global scale atmospheric chemistry-transport models.  Observed ozone that   comes ashore along the North American west coast is referred to as baseline ozone and is the product of   all upwind sources including North American emissions that have circled the globe.  An influential   modelling study by Jacob et al. [1999], written over 16 years ago, demonstrated that increasing ozone   precursor emissions in Asia would have implications for western North America.  They predicted that by   the year 2010 increasing levels of background ozone transported from Asia across the North Pacific   Ocean would offset some of the ozone reductions expected in the western USA from domestic ozone   precursor emissions reductions.     In the decade following the publication of Jacob et al. [1999] routine baseline ozone observations   along the US west coast were not available to confirm the predicted increasing impact of Asian ozone.    Despite limited observations, Cooper et al. [2010] were finally able to compile enough observations from   various platforms to demonstrate that baseline ozone had indeed increased in the free troposphere above   western North America during springtime, and that the rate of increase was greater when the sampled air   masses were transported directly from Asia.  A recent update to the study (shown below in Figure 1)   demonstrates that the positive trend has continued through 2014 at a rate comparable to the observed   ozone increases at two rural high elevations sites near the US west coast.  As predicted by Jacob et al.   [1999] and confirmed by recent observational and modelling studies [Lin et al., 2012; Verstraeten, 2015],   the increase in ozone in the free troposphere and at the high elevation rural sites has occurred even though   reductions in domestic ozone precursor emissions have clearly reduced the extreme urban ozone pollution   episodes most detrimental to human health [Cooper et al., 2014].  This phenomenon is consistent with   observed ozone increases in east Asia [IPCC, 2013; Cooper et al., 2014].     2     On October 1, 2015, the US EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone   from 75 ppbv to 70 ppbv.  This lower standard poses ozone attainment challenges for high elevation   regions of the western United States [Cooper et al., 2015] due to the impact of strong and significant   contributions of background ozone on US surface ozone mixing ratios [EPA, 2014ab].  Despite the   compelling evidence for increasing background ozone there is no ozone monitoring network across the   western United States that can report ozone observations at a temporal and spatial frequency high enough   to reveal the daily quantity of ozone advected into the western USA from across the North Pacific Ocean.    These observations are not even of a high enough temporal or spatial frequency to effectively evaluate the   models used to estimate background ozone.       2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness?   Ensemble chemistry-climate model simulations indicate that the tropospheric ozone burden will   increase by 18% during the 21st century under the RCP8.5 business-as-usual global emissions scenario   [Young et al., 2013].  As shown in Figure 1 baseline ozone impacting western North America has   increased since the 1990s, and model estimates indicate that present-day background ozone can account   for 43% (Los Angeles) to 55% (Denver) of observed ozone in western US cities on high ozone days (> 60   ppbv) [EPA, 2014ab].  The US EPA is developing new policies to address the impact of background   ozone on surface ozone monitors in the USA (http://www3.epa.gov/ozonepollution/actions.html) which   may provide regulatory relief to ozone non-attainment regions.  While these new polices have not yet   been announced it is clear that the impact of background ozone cannot be adequately addressed if the   quantity of background ozone is unknown or poorly estimated.     From both scientific and regulatory points of view, the lower ozone standard is motivating air   quality control planners to seek more accurate and precise attribution of observed ozone to local, upwind   and stratospheric sources of ozone to determine the degree to which domestic emissions must be reduced   in order to attain that standard (http://www.csg.org/aapca_site/).  Accurate quantification of background   ozone under this new paradigm requires enhanced baseline ozone observations at a spatial density and   temporal frequency adequate for evaluating and improving the models.  Once the models can replicate   baseline ozone, greater confidence can be placed on their estimates of background and locally produced   ozone.  Providing timely information on background ozone to air pollution control districts requires a   prompt assessment of the observations and modelling required to accurately quantify the background   ozone impacting the western United States.       3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions?   The impact of rising Asian emissions on western US surface ozone was predicted nearly 20 years   ago but the successful and accurate quantification of these changes has been severely hampered by the   scarcity of observations.  The prospect of geostationary satellite retrievals of tropospheric ozone at high   temporal and spatial resolution combined with in situ observations at high vertical resolution would   finally reveal the magnitude and trends of baseline ozone in all seasons.   NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument is under  development and is designed to operate on a geostationary satellite and provide high frequency retrievals   of tropospheric O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2 and aerosols across the USA and eastern North Pacific   Ocean.  The temporal and spatial coverage of TEMPO will be unprecedented and the instrument’s multi- spectral observations will provide sensitivity to ozone in the lowermost troposphere and will capture   ozone’s diurnal cycle.  However, even if TEMPO is operational by 2019 it will be several years before the  record is long enough to establish a trend.  In the meantime observations through 2014 indicate that ozone   has been increasing in the free troposphere above western North America for at least 20 years, and   continuous high quality observations are required to determine if this trend continues.     The free tropospheric ozone trend shown in Figure 1 depends on all available observations from   any in situ observation platform above western North America.  The frequency of these observations has   diminished in recent years and continued data loss would make it impossible to continue the trend     3     analysis.  Analogous to NASA’s IceBridge Mission (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge) that  is using aircraft to bridge the present gap in the satellite record of polar ice observations, new in situ   ozone observations can bridge the gap until TEMPO is fully operational.  In a recent commentary in the   journal Science, Cooper et al. [2015] describe several observational platforms that can provide high   frequency observations of the baseline ozone flowing into western North America.  Methods include   routine vertical ozone profiles at multiple coastal and inland sites using balloon-borne ozonesondes,   ground-based ozone lidars, or possibly commercial aircraft.  Related options include augmenting the   NASA/NOAA Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet), the NOAA Global Greenhouse Gas   Reference Network’s aircraft program, or the European In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System  (IAGOS).  New ozone and precursor monitoring sites at inland rural locations (especially high elevation)   would be useful for gauging the descent of baseline ozone from the free troposphere into the boundary   layer.     These additional observations would improve detection of inter-annual variability and long-term   trends in baseline ozone.  The observations would then be used to improve the course-scale global models   needed for the routine estimation of background ozone and precursors that are subsequently down-scaled   and input into the best regional air quality models covering the U.S.  They would also allow improved   monitoring of the changes in baseline ozone that have so far only been observed during spring, the only   season with adequate observations for quantifying trends.  Availability of year-round observations,   especially in summer, would allow scientists to explore the possibility of ozone trends in seasons outside   of spring.  Importantly, these observations could be continued into the TEMPO era and utilized for   instrument evaluation as well as providing useful benchmarks at higher vertical resolution.

McKenzie Skiles, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology    Description:  Earth’s vast, remote, and highly reflecting frozen regions respond to, and affect  energy and water budgets across local to global scales. They are spatially  heterogeneous and rapidly changing in mass, extent, and albedo but inadequately  characterized. Global spectroscopic measurements of snow and ice albedo and  heterogeneous controls on albedo can fill key gaps in monitoring and modeling our  changing climate.      Introduction    Decades of satellite, airborne, and ground observations show clear evidence of  increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, declines in sea ice, and decreasing  spring snow cover. The global retreat of our cryosphere is not only the iconic  symbol of climate change, but also threatens the health of polar and mountain  ecosystems. Reduced snowpacks in boreal and montane regions have led to severe  wildfires and unprecedented pest infestations, removing forest cover and exposing  a snowy land surface. These changes are rapidly modifying the albedo of Earth’s  cryosphere, affecting surface energy balance and climate feedbacks from local to  global scales.   Key challenges remain for quantifying and understanding the drivers of, and  responses to, a shrinking cryosphere. Even a few percent shift in the albedo of these     Fig. 1. Observations at instrumented test sites show dominance of absorbed sunlight providing  melt energy, independent of latitude.        highly reflecting regions will result in large changes in absorbed solar energy,  leading to changing melt patterns and climate feedbacks. Current sensors do not  meet the accuracy needs to assess spatial and temporal changes in cryospheric  albedo, nor understanding the controls on those changes.    Without these key data, we cannot adequately represent these critical processes  in the land surface component of hydrology and climate models, nor understand  the relative contribution of greenhouse gas warming to losses of snow and ice.  Global spaceborne observations of cryospheric albedo and related forcings  combined with model assimilation will significantly improve snow and ice melt  predictions, a necessary step in developing adaptive capacity for social-ecological  systems.    Changes in timing and magnitude of snow and ice melt are largely  controlled by change in the absorption of solar radiation at the surface (Fig. 1),  described by albedo. Reduction of snow albedo is controlled mainly by snow grain  size (near-infrared wavelengths) and absorption by impurities (visible wavelengths)  (Fig. 2). Atmospheric warming due to increased greenhouse gases has its strongest  influence on melting through coarsening of snow grain size and resulting decrease  in albedo, but also through sensible heating and longwave irradiance. At the same  time as warming, there have been regional changes in emissions and deposition to  snow and ice of mineral dust and black carbon (BC). The resulting deposition to the  cryosphere darkens the surface and lowers albedo. Increases in snowmelt on the  glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice also lead to lower albedo. Albedo-melt feedbacks  are well known but not accurately captured in the physical representation of snow   processes in models.    Landcover change in  snowy regions also affects albedo  over the vast boreal region and in  mountain areas. Expansion of  woody shrubs at tree line is  decreasing albedo in sensitive  ecosystems. Large-scale wildfire is  removing dark evergreen forest  canopy, revealing the snowy  surface in winter and spring,  thereby increasing albedo on a  regional scale.   The mix of these  albedo forcings and feedbacks   across the global cryosphere is not accurately measured and monitored, leaving  land surface hydrology and climate models poorly constrained.    Multispectral optical remote sensing has long mapped the extent of the  cryosphere and recent algorithmic improvements have squeezed these spectrally  sparse data for indications of snow grain size and radiative forcing by dust and     Fig. 2. These spectral albedo curves show the sensitivity of  snow albedo to grain size and impurity concentrations.         black carbon but with insufficient accuracy.  Multispectral satellite remote sensing  does not meet the spectral resolution requirements to accurately describe and  quantify subtle yet critical changes in cryospheric albedo nor the causes of the  change (e.g. dust, soot, grain size/melt, vegetation changes). Modern spaceborne  imaging spectroscopy has the technological readiness and demonstrated capacity  to acquire such data, with high accuracy, and at low risk of instrumental failure.   What are the key challenges or questions for Earth system science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications and/or operations in  the coming decade?    Key Challenge:   Basic research goal: Understand how changes in snow and ice extent and  reflectivity (including seasonal snowpacks, glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice) affect  energy and water balance at local, regional, and global scales.      Basic research questions:  1) How do changes in snow grain size and radiative forcing by black carbon/dust   affect albedo, energy balance, and melt rates and what is the magnitude of the  radiative feedbacks at local, regional, and global scales?   2) How do changes in surface melt patterns affect sea ice albedo, feedbacks, and  surface energy balance?   3) How do landscape-scale changes in snow-vegetation interactions affect  heterogeneity, albedo, and therefore energy and water budgets?     Applied research goal: Mapping and monitoring changes in the extent and albedo  of snow and ice and translating these observations into actionable information for  applications support.   Applied research questions:  1) How can we accurately represent snow and ice albedo processes and their   feedbacks in land surface hydrology, sea ice, and climate models?  2) How can we accurately represent landscape-scale snow-vegetation   heterogeneity in land surface hydrology and climate models?  3) What are the water resource management implications of changing melt   patterns?    Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect  to readiness?   Current and planned cryosphere missions reveal changes in cryosphere  mass but do not resolve the distribution of energy fluxes that control that melt. That  is, those missions let us know how much snow and ice are changing, but not why.  Moreover, current and planned multispectral missions cannot measure cryospheric  albedo to meet accuracy needs.  In the polar regions, a spaceborne optical imaging  spectrometer can measure reflected solar radiation of snow and ice over the sunlit     season to constrain our understanding of the spectrally varying contributors to  melting and mass change.  In turn, we can quantify albedo-sensitivity to  cryospheric warming, and the relative contributions of warming and albedo  variations to snow and ice losses, combined with the measurements of mass  balance. In snowy regions with forests undergoing disturbance, an imaging  spectrometer can quantify and monitor changing albedo and snow extent, which in  combination with land surface models can assess surface water and energy budgets  for ecosystem recovery.   Climate models have been growing in capacity to fully address energy  balance components and assimilate remote sensing products such spectral albedo  and related data.  By filling voids in observations such as the drivers of snow and  ice albedo variation, we can now constrain these models, leading to a more solid  physical basis to support projections and assessments of mitigation opportunities.   Surface melt versus dynamic ice flux can be better understood to improve our  projections of sea level rise. Characterization of sea ice surface energy balance and  melt onset will be improved. We will gain fundamental and new understanding of  snow-vegetation interactions and their effect on surface-atmosphere interactions.  We will better understand changes in water availability from melting mountain  snowpacks and glaciers, affecting nearly 1/6th of the world’s population.   The technology for the required measurements is now ready based on  investments over the past decade by the for the 2007 HyspIRI Decadal Survey  mission. The instrument would have full spectral coverage from 380 to 2510 nm  with 10 nm sampling. It would have 30-m spatial resolution and a 185 km swath  and could be accommodated on a small satellite, launching from a relatively low- cost Pegasus rocket.    Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these  challenges/questions?-      Global monitoring of cryospheric extent and albedo requires high spectral  resolution and spatially extensive, repeat coverage of vast regions of the globe.  While airborne observations have demonstrated success, most cryospheric regions  are remote and logistically difficult to visit via aircraft with the necessary coverage  and number of repeat acquisitions. Space-based observation is the only practical  way to provide access to these global fingerprints.   Frequent overpasses in the high latitudes during the sunlit season allow  unprecedented observations of the key processes driving recent increases in rates of  snow and ice melt.  In particular, a near-polar orbiting imaging spectrometer will  dramatically improve our knowledge of processes driving polar snow and ice melt.  The Airborne Snow Observatory provides regular acquisitions over selected  western US mountain basins with an imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar to  determine albedo, controls on albedo, and changes in snow water equivalent.   Despite its growing domain, simultaneous acquisitions across polar and global  mountain regions are not possible from aircraft and therefore requires space-based     observation.

created    by    explosive    volcanic    eruptions    have    been   observed    to    scatter    sunlight    back    toward    space,    reducing    the    Earth’s    radiative   heating    and    cooling    the    surface.    The    cooler    surface    and    troposphere    are    also   associated    with    reduced    atmospheric    water    vapor    and    precipitation.    Volcanic   sulfate    aerosols    also    absorb    sunlight    and    terrestrial    radiation,    heating    the   stratosphere,    which    for    optically    thick    volcanic    clouds    can    lead    to    stratospheric   dynamical    changes,    spreading    the    volcanic    aerosols    in    latitude    more    quickly    and   more    extensively    than   would    occur   without    this    heating.   Heterogeneous    chemical   reactions    that    occur    on    volcanic    cloud    particles    alter    stratospheric    chemistry    and   lead    to    changes    in    ozone    concentrations.    Scattering    of    sunlight    by    volcanic    clouds   creates   a   variety   of   optical   phenomena    including:   hazy   skies   during    the   day;    large   bright   regions   of   the   sky   near   sunset   and   sunrise,   which   can   make   it   difficult   to   see   and   cause   traffic   accidents;   a   change   in   the   ratio   of   diffuse   to   direct   sunlight,   which   has    an    impact    on    photosynthesis    and    carbon    uptake;    changes    in    ultraviolet    light   which    alter    photochemical    reaction    rates;    and    beautiful    twilight    displays.    Each    of   these   changes,   and   others   noted   in   Table   1,   are   important   not   only   because   of   their   potential    impacts   on   humans   and   the   environment,   but   also   because   they   teach   us   about   how    the    atmosphere   works,    serve    as    tests    of   Earth    system   models,    provide   analogs   of   how   stratospheric   aerosol   geoengineering   might   function   (including   the   growth    and    transport    of    sulfate    aerosols    as    well    as    the    climate    response),    and   provide    examples    of    the    sensitivity    of    climate    to    perturbations    in    the    Earth’s   radiation    budget.    In    addition,    information    on    volcanic    impacts    provides   foreknowledge   for   government   officials   and   policy   makers.   For   all   of   these   reasons   it   is    important    that    the    science    community   measure    the    structure    and   properties    of   rapidly    evolving    volcanic    clouds    and    the    response   of    the    climate    and    atmospheric   chemistry   to   these   clouds.          2.   Why   is   this   challenge   timely?          During   the   past   decade   advances   in   measurements   of   the   atmospheric   state   and    advances    in    analysis    techniques    have    allowed    the    science    community    to   measure    the    perturbations    to    surface    temperature,    tropospheric    temperature,   stratospheric   temperature,   clear-­‐sky   shortwave   radiation,   atmospheric   water   vapor,   and   precipitation   following   relatively   modest   injections   of   volcanic   material   into   the   stratosphere.    These    injections,    for    example,    have    contributed    to    the    slowing    of   global   warming   in   the   past   decade,   the   so-­‐called   “global   warming   hiatus.”   Given   the   intense    focus    on    climate    change    it    is    increasingly    important    that    we    be    able    to   disentangle   volcanic   effects   from   human-­‐produced   forcings   of   climate.      Models    of    volcanic    aerosols    effects    on    climate    have    advanced    in    the    past   decade    and    several    are    capable    of    tying    together    the    complex    evolution    of   atmospheric   chemistry,   particle   microphysics,   radiative   forcing   and   climate   change   that   occur   after   eruptions.   We   have   reached   an   unprecedented   ability   to   understand   and   organize   the   complex   atmospheric   system.   New    observations    from    aircraft,    balloon    and    satellite    measurements    have   expanded   our   capability   to   measure   this   problem’s   various   components.          3       Taken    together,    these    advances    in   measuring    the    atmospheric    state,    gases,   and   aerosols,   and   modeling   the   impacts   of   particles   on   climate   and   chemistry,   would   allow   us   to   evaluate   the    impact   of    the   next   major   volcanic   eruption,    if   we   are   well   prepared    to    do    so    immediately    after    it    occurs.    This    would    also    improve    the   understanding   of   the   effects   of   more   numerous   smaller   eruptions.           3.   Why   are   space-­‐based   observations   fundamental?   The   atmospheric   state   is   currently   measured   with   a   large   network   of   ground-­‐based,    balloon    and    satellite    instruments.    However,    the    complexity    of    volcanic   impacts   on    climate   and   chemistry    requires    that    a    large   number   of   particulate   and   gaseous   species   be   measured   (see   Tables   2   and   3).   Satellites   can   measure   many   of   these   parameters,   and   are   essential   to   obtain   a   global   data   set   as   the   clouds   evolve.   The   odds   of   a   volcanic   eruption   whose   stratospheric   cloud   is   able   to   force   the   climate   at   more   than   1   W   m-­‐2,   such   as   that   of   Pinatubo    in   1991,   are   about   3%   in   a   given    year.    However,    the    Microwave    Limb    Sounder    instrument    detected    22   injections    of    SO2    into    the    stratosphere,    or    near    the    tropopause,    in    a    period    of    10   years    so    there    are    approximately    two    small    events    for    study    each    year.    Some    of   these   SO2   injections   were   too   small   to   modify   measurably   the   stratospheric   optical   depth,    except    locally.        From    2000    to    2015,    global    or    tropical    optical    depth   measurements    from    satellites    revealed    7    detectable    perturbations    from    volcanic   injections.   The   larger   optical   depth   changes   were   associated   with   measured   changes   in   clear-­‐sky   shortwave   radiation   of   order   0.05   to   considerably   greater   than   0.1   W   m-­‐2.    Analyses    of    climate    perturbations    showed    a    detectable    signal    from   at    least    5    of   these   eruptions.   Therefore,    the   odds   of   a   volcanic   eruption   with   both   a   detectable   injection    and    an    impact    on    the    climate    are    about    30%    in    a    given    year,   with    even   larger    odds    of    smaller-­‐magnitude    eruptions    that    can    nonetheless    provide   information   about   chemical,   microphysical,   and   transport   processes.         Volcanic    eruptions    occur    with    little    or    no    warning.    Most    volcanoes    are   located    in   the   tropics   or   high    latitudes,   where   few   ground-­‐based,   balloon-­‐borne   or   aircraft-­‐borne   instruments   are   readily   available.       Much   of   the   interesting   evolution   occurs   within    a    few   months,    but    clouds   persist    for    few   years.    These    factors   make   satellites    essential    for    many    of    the    needed    measurements.    However,    there    are   measurements    that    satellites    currently    cannot    make,    and    satellites    need    to    be   calibrated.   Therefore,   aircraft   and   balloon   measurements   will   also   be   needed.      4.   What   is   the   ability   of   existing   satellites   to   make   the   needed   measurements?       Table    4    lists    the    satellites    that    are    currently    in    orbit    and   making    relevant   measurements.    Numerous    satellite    instruments    are    able    to    measure    SO2.    Several   instruments   are   able   to   measure   the   column   aerosol   optical   depth.   However,   most   of   these   are   not   able   to   vertically   profile   the   optical   depth.   Nadir-­‐viewing   instruments   have    difficulty    detecting    small    volcanic    clouds    against    the    background    of    the   tropospheric   aerosols.   The   CALIOP   lidar   is   very   valuable   for   high-­‐resolution   vertical   information.   Limb   sounders   such   as   the   Canadian   OSIRIS   or   the   SUOMI   OMPS   limb   sounder    also    provide    useful    vertical    profiles    of    aerosols.    However,    these   measurements   are   not   as   straightforward   as   those   from   previous   solar   occultation   measurements   from   instruments   such   as   SAGE.   Distinguishing   clouds   from   aerosols       4      near   the   tropopause   challenges   many   space-­‐based   measurements.          Unfortunately,   most   of   the   satellites   listed   in   Table   4   are   aging.   It   is   especially   important   that   new   lidars,   and   new   solar   occultation   instruments   are   flown.   There   are   new   types   of   lidars,   high   spectral   resolution   lidars,   which   can   directly   measure   aerosol   optical   depth.   New   lidars   should   also   measure   depolarization   at   visible   and   near   infrared   wavelengths   so   that   dust   and   sulfates   can   be   distinguished   better   than   with   CALIOP   which   only   measures   visible   depolarization.   There   are   also   new   types   of   solar   occultation   instruments   that   can   be   flown   as   constellations   (to   increase   the   frequency   of   measurements),   and   whose   size,   weight   and   cost   are   so   small   that   they   can   be   deployed   as   CubeSats.   These   instruments   can   measure   the   vertical   profiles   of   optical    depth    of    aerosols    as    well    as    the    abundances    of   many    stratospheric    gases,   such   as   water   vapor,    ozone,   hydrochloric    acid,    and   nitrogen   oxides.   They    can   also   distinguish    the    composition    of    aerosols,    for    example    distinguishing    sulfuric    acid   from    dust    with    spectroscopy.    Instruments    such    as    these    will    be    essential    in    the   future    to    accurately    measure    volcanic    particles    and    their    impacts.    Table    5   summarizes   the   highest   priority   satellites.       5.   How   can   we   link   space-­‐based   observations   with   other   observations   to    increase   the   value   of   data   for   addressing   key   scientific   questions   and   societal    needs?       Robust    ground-­‐based,    aircraft    and    balloon    programs    are    essential    for   augmenting    satellite    observations    of    volcanic    clouds.    Table    5    summarizes    the   needed   programs.   These   platforms   should   be   used   to   complete   our   understanding   of   the   stratospheric   sulfur   cycle,   which   has   not   been    fully   explored.   They   should   also   be    used    to    investigate    the    properties    of    the    ambient    aerosol    layer    and    its   perturbations    by    small    volcanic    eruptions    of    the    sort    that    occur    every    few    years.   Understanding    the   background   aerosols   structure   and   composition    is   necessary    in   order   to   understand   how   volcanoes   perturb   that   layer.       The   first   step   in   this   program   should   be   development,   testing,   and   evaluation   of    the    instruments    that    are    currently    available    to    address    the    relevant    issues    in   Tables    1-­‐3.    The    second    step    should    be    to    set    up    a    rapid    response    program    (~    2   weeks)   for   small   balloons   so   that   measurements   can   be   quickly   deployed   and   made   in   clouds   from   small   volcanic   eruptions.   Aircraft   measurements   should   be   directed   to   the   later   stages   (1-­‐2   months   up   to   a   few   years)   of   volcanic   cloud   evolution.   A   plan   should   be   set   up   to   enable   a   relatively   quick   response   using   NASA   aircraft.   This   plan   will   require   that   new   instruments   be   developed   and   tested   in   advance.       6.   What   are   the   anticipated   scientific   and   societal   benefits?       Large   volcanic   eruptions   have   had   dramatic   global    impacts   on   humans   and   the    environment,    as    demonstrated    by    Mt.    Pinatubo.    Some    eruptions    could    be   devastating    to   modern    society   worldwide,   but    these   are    fortunately    rare.   Volcanic   injections   into   the   stratosphere   teach   us   how   the   atmosphere   works,   serve   as   tests   of    Earth    system    models,    provide    examples    of    how    stratospheric    aerosol   geoengineering   might   function,   and   provide   examples   of   the   sensitivity   of   climate   to   perturbations    in    the   Earth’s   radiation   budget.   For   all    these   reasons    it    is    important       5      that    the    science    community    measure    the    properties    of    rapidly    evolving    volcanic   clouds   and   the   response   of   the   climate   and   atmospheric   chemistry   to   them.       7.   What   science   communities   would   be   involved?       A    wide    range    of    science    communities    would    be    involved    in    this    program.   Both    the    stratospheric    and    global    climate    communities    have    worked    on    this   problem.    There    are    substantial    theoretical    activities    underway    both    at    NASA    labs   and   at   universities   related   to   the   issues   discussed   here.   Satellite   groups   are   making   observations,    and    are    also    developing    new    instruments    such    as    those    discussed   here.         Table   1.      Observed   changes   in   climate   and   chemistry   after   eruptions

Vinogradova, J. K. Willis    Introduction    Sea level change (SLC) is a fundamental and sensitive indicator of multiple changes in the Earth  system occurring as a consequence of the rise in Earth's heat uptake mostly caused by increasing  concentrations of greenhouse gases. Sea level changes due to the melting of ice sheets and  glaciers, thermal expansion of the oceans as a result of increases in heat content, changes in land  water storage, changes in ocean circulation, gravitational self-attraction and loading, GIA and a  variety of other factors. As such, sea level science is an inherently multi-disciplinary endeavor.  Glaciologists, oceanographers, hydrologists, geodesists, solid-Earth geophysicists, atmospheric  and climate scientists, and a broad spectrum of other disciplines, are involved in understanding  how changes in the coupled Earth system contribute to SLC along coastlines. According to the  2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, global average sea level will rise between 6 and 33 cm  in the next 20 years. The socioeconomic importance of coastal infrastructure and population  centers threatened by SLC cannot be overstated; over a hundred million people live in densely- populated regions within 1 m of present day mean sea level and even a rise of 20 cm will have  profound impacts on these communities as flood risks and return frequencies of extreme events  increase. It is vital to continuously monitor sea level and the processes that contribute to its  change to gain insight into how these processes are changing and to predict the magnitude and  timescales of future SLC. Current research focuses on understanding the observational record of  ice mass loss, SLC, changes in ocean heat content, and other variables, so that we can build  better dynamic and empirical models to predict future change, especially its regional variations.     Science and Societal Benefits    The scientific and societal benefits of interdisciplinary sea level research are numerous. SLC is  one of the fundamental barometers of how the Earth is responding to climate change, especially  when averaged globally. The extra energy from climate change is reflected primarily in the  melting of ice and the thermal expansion of ocean waters, though sea level can also be affected  by changes in land water storage due to modes of climate variability (e.g., ENSO, PDO, NAO,  etc.) and anthropogenic effects (e.g., pumping of water from aquifers, construction of artificial  reservoirs, oil and gas extraction).  Measurements of SLC and its components are the primary  data records used for evaluating and benchmarking climate models and their projections.  However, there is also an enormous societal benefit from SLC science. Future sea level rise will           2     have a profound impact on coastal infrastructure and societies. Improving the accuracy of current  regional sea level monitoring and future predictions is critical to coastal stakeholders as they plan  their responses to sea level rise. Only with this information can these stakeholders make rational  decisions about the construction of new facilities and coastal protection infrastructure or if  certain coastal areas need to be abandoned altogether.    The Role of Satellite and Airborne Observations    Satellite and airborne observations are crucial for understanding SLC and its components  because of the global and regional comprehensive coverage they provide. This coverage allows  global or regional averaging of the data, which reduces the variability observed in point  measurements, allowing trends to be more easily identified. Satellite radar altimeter  measurements, when averaged globally, can observe global mean sea level variations that on  decadal and longer timescales are largely driven by climate change. Satellite gravity  measurements provide a similar advantage in that complex mass redistributions on the Earth's  surface are naturally integrated by the satellite orbit into unambiguous changes in the regional  distribution of ice and water mass. Satellite gravity measurements, together with laser altimetry,  airborne radar sounding measurements of ice thickness, and InSAR measurements of ice motion,  have become crucial tools for understanding how ice sheets and glaciers are responding to  climate change. Satellite gravity measurements also provide a way of monitoring natural and  anthropogenic changes in land water storage, which dominate global mean sea level variations  on annual and interannual time scales. Tracking the difference between altimeter sea level  measurements and satellite gravity measurements of ocean mass changes offers a method of  greatly enhancing the measurements of changes in ocean heat content that are monitored using  the Argo network of profiling floats above 2000 m depth, but not below. Another important  parameter is vertical crustal motion, which impacts relative SLC along the coasts and our  interpretation of the tide gauge record. These motions are also critical in that they guide the  interpretation of geodetic measurements related to SLC (e.g., GRACE, ICESat, GNSS, etc.),  such as due to GIA.    To date, the primary satellite tools for monitoring sea level-related parameters are: (i) satellite  radar altimetry (for measuring sea surface height - e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and  soon Jason-3 and soon Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 and SWOT); (ii) satellite gravity (for measuring ice  mass loss and mass contributions to SLC - e.g. GRACE and soon GRACE Follow-On; (iii)  satellite radar and laser altimetry (for estimating the changing volume/mass of ice sheets and  glaciers- e.g. ERS/Envisat/CryoSat-2, ICESat and soon ICESat-2); (iv) satellite-based InSAR  (for measuring the speed of outlet glaciers – ERS, Envisat, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS PALSAR- 1/2, and soon NISAR); (v) radar echo sounding from airborne platforms for measuring the  thickness of glaciers and ice sheets (Operation IceBridge) and (vi) GNSS (Global Navigation  Satellite Systems, e.g. GPS for measuring vertical crustal motion). Almost all of these  measurements depend on a precise terrestrial reference frame provided by geodetic  measurements (e.g., SLR, VLBI, GNSS and DORIS). Together, these observations have given us  an unprecedented understanding of SLC over the last several decades. Since 1992, global  average sea level has risen at a rate of 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/year and ~60% of this is due to ice mass  losses from Greenland, Antarctica, mountain glaciers, and changes in land water storage.             3     There are a number of ground and aircraft-based measurements that need to be linked to the  satellite measurements. This is mainly accomplished through GNSS positioning (of tide gauges,  altimeters on aircraft and UAVs, the solid Earth, etc.) using a precise terrestrial reference frame  (TRF) that ties all the measurements together. These GNSS measurements are being used both to  supplement the satellite data (e.g. InSAR measurements of crustal motion and glacier velocities)  and also for validation purposes (e.g. tide gauge measurements of sea level compared to satellite  altimetry). Other measurements have been producing stand-alone products from airborne surveys  that have targeted regions of Greenland, Antarctica, Alaska, Patagonia and the Canadian Arctic  where ice loss is especially dramatic at rapidly evolving outlet glaciers.  Especially important  results have been derived from NASA’s Operation IceBridge. The Argo network of profiling  ocean floats has been critical for assessing changes in upper-to-mid ocean heat content and the  resulting thermal expansion contributions to SLC.    Future Observations Needed to Advance the Science    Although we have been able to quantify and partition the last two decades of SLC, this has only  marginally translated into better numerical models that can project future ice mass loss and SLC  with an accuracy that is useful for stakeholders. A key challenge in sea level science is  developing a better understanding of the dynamics of the glaciers and ice sheets, including their  interactions with the atmosphere, a warming ocean, and their breaking up into icebergs along  calving walls, so that we can predict how quickly they will disintegrate and contribute to SLC.  This remains a leading source of uncertainty for projecting sea level rise over the next 20-200  years. Other problems being studied by sea level scientists include understanding regional  variations in SLC and how to project them; obtaining better estimates of vertical crustal motion  to understand how it exacerbates SLC in some locations and how it can help us better understand  ice mass loss.    The main missing piece of the current suite of space-based observational assets used for sea level  science is the lack of a dedicated InSAR mission to provide continuous and systematic estimates  of glacier velocities, changes in grounding line position and crustal motions immediately  adjacent to regions of large ice mass change. However, there are also numerous improvements to  the existing observational tools that would greatly benefit sea level science including: a)  improved spatial and temporal resolution of satellite gravity measurements, b) improvements to  the Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF), c) improved sea level and vertical crustal motion  measurements in the coastal zone and improved spatial resolution in the open ocean, and d) high- resolution ocean vector winds from scatterometers. In addition, higher resolution coastal digital  elevation models (DEMs) would greatly improve estimates of the impacts of future SLC.  Importantly, long (>20 years) time series and measurement continuity is key to a better  understanding of sea level change. Continuation of precision satellite altimetry (oceans and ice),  radar interferometry, and satellite gravity observations so we can understand the interplay  between interannual, decadal, and long-term climate variability is critical for future scientific  advances in sea level science. An important missing piece for ocean heat content changes is the  role of the deep ocean, which should be addressed by a `Deep Argo` expansion of the Argo  network, and include deployment of Argo floats in hard-to-reach places, e.g. in the polar regions  often occluded with sea ice cover.             4     Projections of sea level contributions from ice sheets and glaciers will remain uncertain unless  confidence in the atmospheric and oceanic forcing used as input for ice sheet models can be  established, and the models are run in a coupled mode, at a high spatial resolution (typically 1  km). Ice-ocean interactions are difficult to address with satellite measurements and require  underwater robotic exploration of the ocean-ice interface, the deployment of airborne drop  sondes, and multibeam echo sounding of the sea floor as done by NASA’s Ocean Melting  Greenland (OMG) mission. Significant progress has been made to reconstruct surface mass  balance using regional atmospheric climate models constrained by re-analysis data, but more  snow radar measurements are needed from airborne platforms to retrieve past accumulation over  a larger area. The largest energy source for melting of ice is solar absorption, the modeling of  which requires improved understanding of ice albedo that will only come with enhanced  observations from satellite radiometers. Novel instruments are needed that can directly measure  surface melt volume and snow/firn density. There is also a critical need for more comprehensive  coverage of ice thickness over ice sheet, ice shelves and glaciers, which requires radar sounders  operating over a variety of frequencies Finally, improved understanding of iceberg calving  requires satellites operating at visible and radar wavelengths with a frequent (daily to sub-daily)  repeat cycle, combining with in-situ observations using GPS, portable InSARs, and robotic  topographic mappers.

French, Michigan Technological University, MichiganView Micah Beck, University of Tennessee, Knoxville P.R. Blackwell, EODN Project Consultant, TexasView Sam Batzli, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WisconsinView Martin Swany, Indiana University Bloomington   An important aspect of remote sensing is delivery and access to the data sets collected by earth observation systems. High-resolution views of the Earth are collected by multiple instruments, providing unique value for all Earth Science disciplines. Many satellite remote sensing systems operate continuously, generating large streams of data that are of interest to science, application, and operation communities.  The nature of communication in most remote sensing applications is both high volume and asynchronous. While some remote-sensing applications require data be delivered on a demanding and rigid timetable, many do not, but they still demand access structures that provide these valuable resources when and where needed. In this white paper we review the need for addressing the challenge of data access within the National Research Council Decadal Survey in Earth Science and Applications from Space. We represent a group of researchers and educators affiliated with the AmericaView consortium (http://americaview.org/) who are working on issues of earth observation data access. The impacted community for this challenge is very large, and solutions range widely. The challenge is fundamental to data use and will become more of a challenge as data volumes increase and remote sensing becomes more ubiquitous, especially globally. Due to advances in data logistics, new solutions are possible as long as there is sufficient consideration of the challenges as remote sensing systems are developed and deployed. The role of our public service agencies in providing free and open access to the valuable data collected with publically funded satellite systems needs close consideration by the Decadal Survey team. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? One of the key challenges for Earth System Science is the delivery of high-volume data for science, applications, and operations of all kinds. In particular is access to data in places that have challenges in their connection to the part of the global Internet where such data is generated and stored. This can be due to a lack of connectivity or because the data resources are “big” with respect to the connection capacity. Fast transfer of large files on demand can serve applications that are well connected, or a fast network can be used to replicate large data libraries in remote locations and serve those applications from local copies of those files. These approaches are the basis of the commercial strategy known as “Content Delivery” that is used by applications such as Netflix to distribute large collections to a very wide audience. The strategies developed for effective content delivery, and the framework for providing this capacity, need to be considered by NASA, NOAA, and other federal agencies providing remote sensing data to its user base. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? As data volumes increase and remote sensing data use becomes more ubiquitous, data access will be very important to address, particularly for users with limited connectivity. Fortunately, there are new ideas to help address this challenge. The confluence of the prospect of more and larger earth observation data along with new solutions to connectivity that go beyond extensive infrastructure development makes the challenge we have described a timely topic for the Decadal Survey.  In addressing the problem of how to serve applications with connectivity challenges, several approaches are possible. One approach is to upgrade the infrastructure that serves such applications, but this approach may be expensive and difficult to implement in some parts of the world. For example, one development strategy includes deploying balloons or solar-powered drones flying permanently in the stratosphere over Africa, an idea with grand challenges and expense. An alternative approach takes advantage of the fact that high volume asynchronous communication can be accomplished over connectivity that is in many ways challenged, as long as the cumulative volume of data delivered is large enough and fast enough to meet application requirements. The term used for this approach is Logistical Networking (http://loci.cs.utk.edu/scidac/), and the central concept is to stage data delivered from the network to storage servers that are close to the application from the point of view of network topology. When data is replicated to locations that are well connected to the application network, data access can be high performance; from the point of view of the user, these data are fully accessible. An example of this concept is the Earth Observing Depot Network (EODN; http://data-logistics.org/?q=EODN), a content delivery network being developed by AmericaView and the NSF-funded Data Logistics Toolkit (DLT) project to distribute Landsat 8 and other data from satellite-based instruments. USGS currently generates Landsat 8 data on the order of 1TB each day. The scale of data access requirements can strain the capacity of the central repository at the USGS EROS Center. Once fully on-line, the EODN will be able to serve a purpose similar to that of commercial Content Delivery Networks in spreading and localizing this data-access traffic, providing the capability to support unlimited downloads at the highest available network speeds. One key point is that the EODN infrastructure is built and operated by the scientific end-user community, rather than by the data provider (USGS) or by a private sector service provider that is in the business of delivering and charging profit-making rates for access to content. When data is staged locally at network locations that are connectivity challenged, the result is an “island” of content that is now available at very high performance within that locality. An additional advantage of locally staged data lies in the ability to control what data are moved to local servers. Controlling the flow of data so that it is available when and where it is needed is an important consideration, particularly in connectivity challenged environments. The plethora of data available today can be overwhelming, both for network infrastructure and analysts, particularly during periods of high stress such as those caused by manmade or natural disasters. The experience of users accessing content staged in this way on local servers will depend on the nature of backbone connectivity available. For example: · A server that is regularly, but not continuously, connected at high bandwidth (for instance, by satellite connectivity) may be capable of large-scale scheduled updates to locally staged content.  · A server that is constantly connected by a very low bandwidth connection, possibly with a high error rate, might be able to support a large content collection that does not change too often.  The idea of using a local server to stage and serve content locally is not a new one, nor is Logistical Networking the only approach currently being offered. Some examples include: · Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN; originally Interplanetary Internet) is a project that was proposed by JPL scientists as a means to avoid building a new data networking infrastructure for every space mission. It has been adapted in a DARPA project as Disruption Tolerant Networking for battlefield networking, and has also been proposed as a means of connecting remote areas. · Outernet is a satellite-based Content Distribution project that proposes solar-powered servers to be placed in remote locations, creating a wireless Local Area Network to serve downloaded content.  A unique feature of the Logistical Networking architecture is that it is built on an infrastructure that is designed to be as simple, generic, and limited as possible. One of the key aspects of networking that has been provided by a common Internet infrastructure is interoperability. The more complex or specialized services described above have their place in the stack of protocols that can be delivered to connectivity-challenged locations; Logistical Networking provides a common basis on which they and many other possible services can be implemented. The idea is that these design goals are most likely to result in an infrastructure that can survive over time, meeting the goals of many user communities and be implemented in many ways as technology evolves. This approach is modeled after the most successful Internet infrastructure models of the past 50 years, namely the Internet and the Unix/Linux kernel interface, and defines a unique strategy for achieving global ubiquity. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? For this final question, of course, space-based observations are not fundamental for addressing this challenge, but to turn this question around, access to space-based earth observation data fundamentally requires improved and progressive means to deliver timely data and data sets to the people and decision systems that use the data. Remote sensing users within U.S. Federal agencies, universities, K-12 educational entities, and resource management decision-makers need the NRC Decadal Survey team to consider the challenge of access to earth observation data, since it is the public sector that is financing and creating these data and who have the most at stake if they are not available. There is a concern by some in our community that free and open access to data developed, collected, and stored by government groups will become so difficult to access that we will be reliant on the private sector to use these valuable resources. Data stewardship is fundamental to good and open science, and it starts with free data access and effective dissemination. We urge the NRC Decadal Survey team to consider making data access a fundamental point of discussion so that our science and applications communities can rely on these data for their needs.   1  ", "section":"n/a", "authors_both":""}

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? How much will sea level rise (by the end of the 21st century)? Space-based and ground-based observations over the last century have shown that sea level is rising on a global scale. A continued rise over the next century and beyond would pose a serious financial and social threat to coastal communities and infrastructures as people and structures may need to be relocated to adapt to flooded coastal zones. By various estimates hundreds of millions of people and hundred of billions of dollars in infrastructure are at risk (Kamal-Chaoui et al, 2009).  In addition, a national security threat might exist from the social stresses of potentially large population motions within and across national borders (DoD, 2014). Hence, it is of high importance to increase our ability to predict potential future rates of sea level change under different climate scenarios. Current estimates of Sea Level Rise (SLR) range from 0.3 to 2 m by 2100 (Melillo et al, 2014).  This large range makes it difficult for government and business to address the risk appropriately. If the global value is as uncertain as indicated by these vastly different estimates it is impossible to predict regional to local changes along the coasts. However, once global to regional uncertainties are minimized, models of coastal variability (tides, storm surge, elevation models) can be used to bound the percentage change along the coast. Thus, it is necessary to have a global observing system in place that then not only observes the current rates of global and regional sea level rise but also helps us to improve our understanding of its causes and the physics needed to better model and predict it. Sea level change is a non-linear and highly complex response to changes in global climate and is, thus, not only a concern to the oceanographic community but requires research by the entire water cycle research community including glaciology and hydrology. In particular, the ocean and cryosphere have very long response times to disturbances (many decades to thousands of years).   Key observables: · Sea surface height and ocean mass: global and regional patterns >50 km · Water mass flux between ocean and land · Land hydrology/ocean exchange (5-10 year fluctuations) · Ice mass change; ice velocities (10-100+ years) When considering implementing a future global observation system there are two subquestions to consider that address necessary observables in order to reduce uncertainties in future predictions: a) How can we separate short term from long term variability?  Key point: Extending the ocean observations of sea level (altimetry) and mass (gravimetry) necessary to distinguish between interannual/decadal variability (10-20 years) and long term trends/acceleration. (50 years or longer). Key measurements: Ocean altimetry; Gravimetry Over the past two decades, we have observed a global rate of ~3 mm/yr sea level rise, about 2/3 from ice (glaciers and ice sheets) and 1/3 due to thermal expansion. With two decades of altimetry and one decade of gravimetry observations, combined with a global in-situ ocean temperature and salinity sensing network (CTD, ARGO), we now have a better understanding of the regional patterns of oceanic variability and the heat vs. mass distribution in the ocean. The most important question is how will the contributing processes respond to changes in future climate and what will be their aggregated impact be on sea level change.. Limitations in the fidelity of current state-of-the-art models prevent us from being able to reproduce even the current observed SLR rates in the ocean (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation variability). Thus, while there is still a lack of understanding of some of the most important physical mechanisms that drive variability in the ocean on various time scales it is of high importance to continue to monitor current rates and patterns. Continuing the observing system currently in place to monitor the ocean will be crucial to the ability to separate interannual and decadal variability from a trend or acceleration and to connect the large scale variability to coastal systems.  b) Are the contributions changing over time?  Key points: Monitoring the water mass flux between components (ocean, land, land ice) necessary for improving physical understanding of the drivers. Land ice as the biggest potential contributor needs particular attention Key measurements: Gravimetry; Altimetry; InSAR; Ice penetrating radar  As touched upon above, sea level change is essentially a non-linear response of the water cycle to changes in atmospheric conditions. The primary contributors to sea level change are density changes of the ocean and freshwater fluxes. Density changes, global and regional, can mostly be bounded by a combination of space based altimetry and gravimetry and models, which can be addressed with the implementation to answer a). Mass changes (currently directly measured by GRACE) are complex in their origin on various time scales and have the potential to cause the biggest and most rapid change in global sea level. The primary contributions include variability in land hydrology, atmospheric mass transports, and ice mass change. Currently, land hydrology and atmospheric moisture transports have high impacts on interannual time scales, and are important to explaining the current decade-long satellite observations. However, ice mass variations, clearly have the greatest potential for impacting sea level change in the future. The most significant uncertainties in ice sheet model predictions stem from currently insufficiently observed boundary conditions and parameters. Extending the ice observing system to include measurements of velocities and bed topography will help to constrain ice sheet models better to reflect sudden and long term changes in ice flow. 2. Why are these challenge/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? Key points: Measurements are needed to reduce uncertainties in projections to a level where they are useful to decision makers, however, no observing system is in place after ~2020. Key tasks: Monitoring ocean to track unexpected (unmodeled) changes in contributions and patterns and separate short term from long term change. Reduce uncertainties in ice sheet projections as key player for long term change. Ocean Observing System: While space observations have been available to help our understanding of sea level change on a global scale for at least the past two decades, the current program is presently only fully funded through about 2020 (GRACE FO: 2017; Jason-3: 2015/6 launch dates).  Tentative plans are in place to fund continuity ocean altimetry through about 2025 (Sentinel 6A&B / Jason-CS: ~2020 and beyond), however, these continuity missions are not yet fully confirmed by NASA/NOAA, and there is no firm approval for a gravimetry continuity mission beyond GRACE FO. There are currently processes on interannual to decadal time scales that cannot be unraveled without having a longer time series of data. In order to distinguish decadal/interannual variability from a trend (i.e. 50 years) a long enough observational record needs to be established covering at least one full cycle (ideally two) - this could be achieved by extending altimetry and gravimetry measurements. It is important to note that the recent NRC Panel on Continuity of NASA Earth Observations from Space: A Value Framework ranks altimetry and gravimetry observations very highly in terms of science value provided and cost. Land Ice Observing System: Another key to improved understanding and prediction is to improve the physics in current ice sheet models that predict sea level change. This requires a continuation of current measurements of ice change plus selected new measurements. Note that we require continuity to help us understand long term ice sheet physics and average parameter values, but also to look for nonlinear rapid changes in ice dynamics (collapses) that are extremely difficult to predict even with excellent models. For this ice monitoring system and to help assimilate data into and tune ice sheet physical models we require ice mass (GRACE-type), ice elevation (ICESat-2), and ice sheet velocity  (NISAR and other InSAR) measurements from space. Note that after the GRACE Follow-On and ICESat-2 launch 2017 with a lifetime goal of 5 years there is currently no plan in place to continue these measurements. The NISAR mission should provide ice velocity data through about 2025 on the current development schedule. One significant short coming in state-of-the-art ice sheet modeling is the limited knowledge of bed topography. Grounding line retreat is highly depended on the slope the ice is resting on – a downward slope speeds up the flow whereas an upward slope slows the flow down. Currently, ice sheet bed topography is known at mixed scales of resolution and vertical accuracy, generated from gravimetry, and sparse local airborne ice penetrating radar measurement sets.  A space-based ice-penetrating radar with enough power to image the bottom of the ice sheets would help substantially improve the knowledge of bed topography, and potentially give some insight into ice layers and hence history as well.  3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? Key points: In-situ measurements only provide local views. Space observations are needed to increase physical understanding of global processes and connect regional to local changes. Space based observations are fundamental to understanding sea level change as they are the only means to provide a global view of the rates of sea level as well as contributing components. In situ observations only provide a local view and are hence, difficult to use to separate different contributions and remote forcing. Only global observations can provide a view of a) global to regional changes in the ocean and b) paint a clear picture of the contributions of the water cycle. NASA’s multi-decadal experience with ocean altimetry, ocean mass, and ice mass/elevation/velocity measurements in conjunction with assimilating modeling systems have now placed us in position to develop more quantitative analyses for specifying observational requirements aimed at improving projections of sea level rise.  This experience base and modelling capability also enables a candidate method for suggesting measurement system priorities relative to having the largest impact on reducing uncertainty in future SLR projections. As underlined before, the biggest uncertainties stem from our lack of knowledge of the future behavior of the ice sheets. With a total ice mass to raise sea level by more than 60 m, the ice sheets also have the biggest potential to impact global sea level significantly. While the ice sheets are geographically limited it is still impossible to comprehensively monitor changes or static properties such as bed topography using in-situ or airborne observations only. Particularly, the interior of the ice sheets remains almost inaccessible when limited to ground based or airborne observations.   Because of the risk to society, because of NASA’s clear leadership in measuring and understanding sea level rise in the last two decades, and because of the variety of space borne missions needed for a complete picture of the forcings and responses, we believe that a Panel under this NRC Committee should be devoted to Sea Level.

In  particular, knowledge of the volume of the seasonal snowpack, its variations in space and  time, and its interactions with climate and society, remain surprisingly poorly  constrained.  While most other components of the terrestrial water cycle are currently  being observed from space (or will be within the next 5 years), a critical missing link is a  satellite mission for measuring key components of the snowpack, especially its snow  water equivalent, snow color and albedo.       In order to address fundamental questions of human and water security, the Earth science  community must ultimately provide a comprehensive water cycle observing system. Such  a system must include space-based assets for monitoring storage of snow and ice, and  also for surface water, soil moisture and groundwater storage, as well as the fluxes of  precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff/streamflow. These observations should be  integrated into an advanced hydrological modeling platform that also includes in situ and  aircraft data.       Once assembled, such a framework would enable holistic assessment of freshwater  availability from regional to global scales that will significantly advance water cycle  research and greatly enhance sustainable water management. At present, lack of  understanding of the dynamics of seasonal snow volume variations and their Earth  system interactions remains a critical obstacle to progress.    1. What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the  spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the  coming decade?    In spite of several decades of effort and investment in hydrologic observing resources and  modeling capabilities, critical gaps in our understanding of the stocks and fluxes of the  terrestrial water cycle still exist.  For example, important difficulties remain in     understanding a) the volume of terrestrial freshwater on the planet; b) how it is  distributed among snow, ice, surface water, soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs, and  c) how these storages and associated fluxes vary in space and time (1).   Addressing this  challenge is both essential for supporting basic and applied research, and fundamental for  enabling sustainable water management, from local scales to the scales of large, trans- boundary aquifers and watersheds.    While important advances have been made in understanding soil moisture (2), surface  water (3) and groundwater (4) variations, characterizing variations in seasonal snowpack  volume (ie. its snow water equivalent [SWE] and albedo) and its interactions with climate  remain perhaps the most significant, large-scale unknowns in hydrologic science (5).    The alpine snowpack dominates the hydrologic cycle in most high latitude and high  altitude regions of the world, controlling a diversity of processes from biogeochemical to  ecologic to climatic, as well as practical concerns such as seasonal flooding and water  availability. Lower altitude snow cover is equally important, playing a central role in  seasonal albedo and ground insulation changes. However, methods for estimating the  volume of water stored in the seasonal snowpack remain primitive; and the lack of  routine SWE and changing color and albedo information have limited the progress of  hydrologic and climate science in this critical area.    Note that understanding the size of the seasonal snowpack, its dynamics and its Earth  system interactions fit squarely into a broader, practical understanding of global water  availability.  Society, and we as Earth scientists, must strive to answer a set of practical  questions that form the foundation of sustainable water resources management.  These  include:     • How much water do we have – as snow, ice, surface water, soil moisture and  groundwater?   • How much do we need – for the humans and the environment, to grow food, for  energy production and for economic growth?   • How is the gap between supply and demand changing with time – due to  population growth, climate change, advances in technology, changes in human  behavior and water management?      Clearly, significant progress towards characterizing the seasonal snow load – namely its  water equivalent but also its optical properties as well as its extent – is essential to answer  the questions above.  Note further that the challenge is an observational one, but also one  of maintaining a robust network of ground-based hydrological measurements, airborne  campaigns, and of ingesting these observations into data integration platforms. Given that  climate and the hydrological cycle are changing, and that world population and  associated food and energy requirements are growing, it is essential that an overarching  observational-modeling framework that includes major snow properties including SWE  and albedo is established to address the issues listed above.      2. Why are these challenge and questions timely to address now especially with     respect to readiness?      Timeliness is relevant to both societal need and to technological readiness.  The narrative  above underscores the pressing need to address major unknowns in water availability,  and therefore in water, food, energy, national and human security.  It is simply impossible  to advance critical issues in sustainable water management unless the most fundamental  issues outlined above are embraced and addressed.  Changes in the seasonal snow water  volume represent perhaps the largest unknown in total, annual renewable terrestrial water  storage.    Technologically, the capabilities now exist or are being developed to a) observe the major  stocks and fluxes of the terrestrial water cycle; and b) to integrate them into advanced,  data-integrating hydrological models to provide the best-available, holistic assessment of  the stocks and fluxes of the terrestrial water cycle.  The hydrologic community is  fortunate that an array of terrestrial water cycle satellites has been launched (SMAP (2),  GRACE (6) or will be launched (SWOT (3), GRACE-FO, ECOSTRESS) in the near  future. Importantly, other white paper input to this RFI point out the needs for surface  and root zone soil moisture (7), for joint sediment/carbon remote sensing (8), for snow  water equivalent and albedo (9) and more.    While all of surface water, soil moisture and groundwater are (or will be) measured by  current and future missions, measurement of the SWE of alpine and lowland snowpack  remains a critical missing link in a space-based observing system.  Likewise,  characterization of albedo/snow color, which are now known to strongly influence  seasonal melt rates and snowpack life, is essential to understand the timing of spring  melting, changing snow season length, spring green-up, etc. When viewing the water  cycle as a whole, we make the point in this white paper that a spaceborne snow mission  will help close the water storage balance and provide near complete coverage of all major  terrestrial water reservoirs.  Given the demonstrated success of airborne snow  observations (e.g. NASA’s Airborne Snow Observatory), science and applications, a  snow water equivalent mission is timely -- technologically, scientifically and societally.    3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges  and questions?    A comprehensive picture of the distribution Earth’s freshwater over and through the land  surface will only result from a combination of in situ observations, space-based  measurements, and a data-integrating modeling framework. Unfortunately, in situ  observational networks are insufficient for providing observations at space-time  frequencies required to address the problems outlined above. Moreover, from a global  perspective, international data sharing, including policies of data denial, remain in many  cases, immovable obstacles.  Satellites offer the global, apolitical perspective that is an  important cornerstone of Earth observing (1).     The challenges of in situ snow monitoring are many, in particular in mountainous  regions. While the sight of the lone snow observer on cross-country skis is a quaint     reminder of how we can best measure snow depth and snow water equivalent at a point, it  is impossible to construct a meaningful, mountain range-wide estimate with such an  approach. A satellite-based SWE mission represents the only way to capture variations in  the world’s mountainous regions, and one that is essential for advancing hydrologic  science, applications and for modernizing regional water management.  Similarly, it will  be impossible to map changing snow albedo and color without a dedicated spaceborne  platform.    References     1. Famiglietti, J. S., A. Cazenave, A. Eicker, J. T. Reager, M.

What are the key challenges or questions for Earth System Science across the spectrum of basic research, applied research, applications, and/or operations in the coming decade? Our estuaries, coastal oceans and lakes are critically important as habitat for aquatic life, as highly productive ecosystems, fresh water and protein sources for human consumption, as strong economic drivers for coastal communities, and as a highly dynamic interface between land and ocean carbon and nutrient cycles. Coastal and lacustrine ecosystems are highly dynamic, economically valuable and particularly sensitive to both natural and human induced change. Coasts will be exposed to increasing risks over the coming decades given future projections for sea level rise, increasing population growth, increasing severity and frequency of extreme events, and increasing degradation of coastal ecosystems (IPCC, 2014). Approximately 50% of the world's human population lives in coastal regions generating about 46% of global economic activity (LOICZ, 2014). In order to sustain food production and ecological health while still maintaining economic growth in coastal regions, we must move quickly toward a better understanding of several key questions, as highlighted below: How are the productivity and biodiversity of coastal marine and lacustrine ecosystems changing, and how do these changes relate to natural and anthropogenic forcing, including local to regional impacts of climate variability?  Coastal ecosystems are less than 5% of the global ocean but account for ~15-21% of the global ocean net primary production, the majority of marine living resources harvested for human consumption, and approximately 35-44% of the global ocean sequestration of carbon from the photic zone occurs within continental margins.  Coastal ecosystems also receive the great majority of anthropogenic inputs (except CO2) from rivers and coastal runoff and by nature of their proximity to dense coastal populations. The dynamics of net community production and biodiversity are expected to change in response to changes to riverine fluxes, atmospheric inputs, ocean acidification, human activities including coastal development and pressure on wild fisheries, or climate induced changes in physical processes affecting the status of upwelling and nutricline depth.   How are variations in exchanges across the land-ocean interface related to changes within the watershed, and how do such exchanges influence coastal and open ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem dynamics?  Exchanges of materials from land to ocean are a function of seasonal discharge dynamics, atmospheric deposition, and land surface attributes that are influenced by a host of natural and anthropogenic processes. Land to ocean subsidies of nutrients, labile carbon, light attenuating substances, net buffering capacity and pollutants can have profound effects on wetland, estuarine, riverine and coastal ocean ecosystems, including commercially important fish and shellfish populations. Pollution is altering ecosystems in many regions suffering from population pressure, and ecosystems dominated by mangroves are disappearing as a result of increasing marine protein demands requiring more intensive aquaculture.    How do short-term coastal and open ocean processes interact with and influence larger scale physical, biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics?  The large-scale response of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems to climatic, atmospheric and anthropogenic forcing is the integral of processes occurring on smaller and shorter scales. Examples include vertical mixing, horizontal advection, upwelling, air-sea exchange, primary production, grazing, and respiration. The interplay of such dynamic processes drives the transfer of matter and energy on regional and global scales, affecting ecosystem function and human societal well-being. Gaining a more detailed understanding of how microorganisms respond to highly ephemeral, spatially varying processes at small spatial and temporal scales is therefore central to attaining a predictive understanding of the longer term and larger scale consequences of environmental change.   How do episodic hazards, contaminant loadings, and alterations of habitats impact the biology and ecology of the coastal zone?  The effects of episodic hazards, such as hurricanes and other extreme storms, floods, tsunamis, chemical spills, Sargassum landing on beaches, and harmful algal blooms are especially challenging to observe.  Yet it is these events that can have the most severe and lasting effects on coastal ecosystems and threaten the health of humans using those waters.  Additionally, anthropogenic influences through land use and other activities alter wetland and riparian habitats, alter watershed flow, increase sediment loads, and cause blooms of toxic algae, thereby harming aquatic plants, invertebrates, fish and wildlife and human health.    2.  Why are these challenges/questions timely to address now especially with respect to readiness? Addressing these key science questions requires an innovative observational approach to enable quality space-based observations at high enough temporal and spatial resolutions to capture the dynamic processes. On a geostationary orbit, NASA’s GEO-CAPE mission would provide this novel capability and is already at a high science and technology readiness level. This readiness has been the focus of the NASA GEO-CAPE mission design and science working groups that have been meeting regularly since 2009. These GEO-CAPE pre-formulation teams along with other NASA investments have resolved the technological and scientific challenges involved to address the scientific questions discussed herein. Furthermore, the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of geostationary ocean color observations with the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) sensor launched in 2010. 3. Why are space-based observations fundamental to addressing these challenges/questions? Geostationary ocean color observatories are capable of sampling at high temporal frequency (e.g., hourly) over spatial scales of less than 0.5 km.  Only geostationary observations are capable of providing the crucial link between high-frequency surface observations of moderate spatial extent and global satellite retrievals from low Earth Orbit (LEO) sensors with limited temporal resolution.  High spectral resolution will be needed for discriminating various aquatic constituents, including identification of phytoplankton functional groups.  Moreover, a geostationary vantage point would have the ability to resolve biological variability at sub-hourly to diurnal time scales. The combined high temporal and spatial resolutions will permit more detailed assessments of the extent and duration of damage to coastal habitats from pollution events, disasters and alterations. More frequent observations also improve the detectability of day-to-day variations in processes, and lead to more cloud-free observations to reduce uncertainties resulting from less-frequent observations.   a. Can existing and planned U.S. and international programs provide the capabilities necessary to make substantial progress on the identified challenge and associated questions? If not, what additional investments are needed? Our present capabilities to remotely observe coastal processes from space are critically limited in their temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution. Present LEO observations on average can provide one or two observations per week at most locations after discounting cloud cover, thus cannot capture the highly dynamic processes characteristic of coastal regions, transformation rates, and net growth processes at diurnal time scales. Further, retrievals from coastal waters pose additional challenges including the need for better spectral and spatial resolution, increased signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and complexities in calibration and validation efforts compared to open ocean retrievals.  Investments in geostationary missions offer a solution to these issues and will enable new perspectives into coastal science. The data collected with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution will more accurately guide coastal ocean science and policy, including partnerships with environmental managers and operational practices. b. How to link space-based observations with other observations to increase the value of data for addressing key scientific questions and societal needs; Watershed processes must be considered over spatial extents of tens to millions of square kilometers and varying time scales (hours to decades). It will be necessary to employ an integrated suite of models, remotely sensed data and targeted in situ observations in order to understand processes controlling fluxes on land, their coupling to riverine systems, delivery of materials to the coastal ocean and the corresponding coastal ecosystem responses. It will be important to foster international and interagency partnerships linking to other such observations around the globe (e.g., Korea’s GOCI-II, Europe’s OCAPI) within a global observation framework that includes LEO, surface, and deep water observation networks.   c. The anticipated scientific and societal benefits; and d. the communities involved Geostationary Ocean Color data will be used by aquatic biologists and biogeochemists to gain new knowledge needed to address the questions outlined above. It will also inform the general public, federal, state, and local governments to assess designated use integrity and the ability to sustain human health and ecosystem services.  The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, which had both episodic and longer-term effects on the environment, is one example where data from such a mission would have been extremely valuable. High frequency monitoring of harmful algal blooms will permit informed management decisions that promote conservation of fisheries and protection of human health.  Other severe impacts can result from loss of coastal marshlands due to sea level rise that occurs so gradually that it is difficult to observe, or episodic severe weather events that can rapidly alter coastal morphology.  In the future, major U.S. ports along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico are planning to accommodate the new generation of super-cargo ships, which will be able to pass through the Panama Canal once expansion is completed in 2016. Monitoring of the impacts of dredging operations, as well as future shipping and potential accidents, would be valuable uses of geostationary observations, as effective response and prediction relies on accurate and timely information that is updated frequently.

The PBL controls surface fluxes as well as the temperature range  and concentration of gases (water vapor, CO2, pollutants), aerosols, and chemical  constituents that humans and ecosystems experience.  In addition, the turbulence in the  PBL and its coupling with free-tropospheric conditions controls convective initiation,  cloud coverage as well as pattern and intensity of precipitation.  The PBL is thus a critical  layer in the atmosphere, but is still not optimally represented both in current weather and  climate models as well as in observations.    As a result, there is an established and growing need for PBL observations over land for  research in hydrology, ecology, land-atmosphere interaction, turbulence, cloud and  convection processes, turbulence (e.g. large eddy simulations (LES)), and  aerosol/chemistry studies as well as associated weather and climate model evaluation and  development (Zeng et al., 2015). Modulated strongly by PBL structure, evolution, and  feedback processes (e.g. entrainment and atmospheric circulation at the meso- to macro- scale), an improved PBL representation will have profound impacts on society, surface  hydrology (namely soil moisture and runoff), its connection to clouds and precipitation,  and anthropogenic influences (e.g., CO2 and pollution gases), and extreme weather in a  changing climate.    1.1 Need for Space-based Observations  The last ten years have seen considerable attention and mission support dedicated to  individual components of Earth’s water and energy cycles as a result of the 2007 Decadal  Survey.  This includes land surface states and fluxes (e.g. soil moisture, snow, surface  temperature, groundwater, evapotranspiration) and atmospheric quantities and profile     information above the PBL (e.g. temperature, humidity, clouds, precipitation).  The PBL,  however, remains a major gap in our observational suite and is therefore currently a  limiting factor in observational process studies. Ground-based remote sensing and in-situ  (i.e. radiosonde) measurements of the thermodynamic and kinematic structure and  evolution of the PBL will continue to be limited to short-term field campaigns and  spatially restricted networks for the foreseeable future.  Spaceborne instruments, on the  other hand, would afford the ability to monitor and improve understanding of these  processes on global and multi-year scales. Recent (post-2007 Decadal Survey)  community recommendations from both NRC and NASA have in fact acknowledged  that PBL observations, particularly from space, are essential to improving weather and  climate services to society as well as filling the gaps in process-level understanding  (Carbone et al. 2009; Dabberdt et al. 2010; Zeng et al., 2015).  Even so, there is very little  attention or planning (short or long-term) in place for improving lower tropospheric  thermodynamic sounding from space and, as a result, PBL research and observations  have been identified as a ‘terra incognita’ in current agency programmatic focal areas.     1.2 Timeliness   The impacts of the PBL on water and energy cycles are typically felt at sub-daily  timescales (e.g. 1-3 hourly) and at ~100m vertical and ~100m-10km spatial scales.  To  this end, the current suite of spaceborne instruments has seen only limited advances in  instrument technology and algorithms as they relate to PBL (height and structure)  retrieval.  Hyperspectral sounders such as AIRS and IASI are the most capable in terms  of spectral (and hence, vertical) resolution, but retrievals have not been tailored for the  PBL and are strongly limited by cloud cover and surface emissivity effects. Standard  lidar (e.g. CALIPSO) can obtain high vertical resolution of backscatter, but is limited in  return time and spatial sampling and does not provide thermodynamic state information.   Geostationary satellites (e.g. GOES) have the required temporal (i.e., 15-min to 1-hr)  coverage, but are limited by having only a few IR channels capable of resolving the PBL.   GPS-RO shows some promise for PBL retrieval, but is limited by irregular sampling,  multipath effects, and confounding issues related to humidity and topography, as well as  the inability to capture variations horizontally in the thermodynamic field.  Thus, while  each of these sensors have some lower tropospheric monitoring capabilities, there are  even more limitations that make them impractical for routine PBL observations.  It is  therefore timely to assess how available technologies, including CubeSats, can be  leveraged, combined, or evolved in order to form a dedicated mission or sub-mission to  routinely monitor the PBL on diurnal timescales.      2          Key Challenges and Science Questions  • How can we quantify and improve the process-level and diurnal cycle   representation of the water (including precipitation), carbon and energy cycles in  weather and climate models?   o PBL monitoring is required to address unresolved issues related such as  those to surface heterogeneity, entrainment, stable and transitional PBLs,  urban PBLs, aerosol, and land use change impacts.   o PBL is a regulator of the highly uncertain soil moisture-precipitation  feedback and the role of surface land cover gradients and change.     • When and where, globally, are the mechanisms that support hydrological and  climatic extremes (such as drought) amplified or suppressed by PBL processes  and feedbacks?   o Feedbacks of soil moisture on temperature and precipitation are PBL- dependent and are strongly connected with the evolution of extreme  events.   o The diurnal cycle of the PBL is dependent on climatic regime and surface  soil moisture and vegetation states.   • How can the PBL be used to integrate and improve estimation of other water,  energy, and carbon cycle components that are difficult to monitor from space (e.g.  surface fluxes (ET), winds speed, pollutants)?     3     Space-based Observations and Synergies with other Data  To fully retrieve the structure and evolution of the PBL, the community will need to  bridge the gap between current disparate attempts across missions (mentioned above) to  characterize the PBL over land and determine the challenges for improving retrieval of  PBL height and lower tropospheric thermodynamic profiles via next-generation satellite  technology.  This will require a) an evaluation of the current methods and products  related to PBL remote sensing from satellite, b) identification of the most likely  approaches that will meet weather/climate modeling, process-level understanding and  human health needs, and c) determination of the instrument and mission strategy that can  achieve these goals.    One potential approach is to synergistically use both space-borne (active and passive) and  ground-based remote sensing to simultaneously retrieve the thermodynamic structure of  the PBL.  The high vertical resolution and PBL height detection from active sensors  compliments the true thermodynamic sounding capability of passive sensors.  The  majority of the information content in ground-based spectral observations is in the PBL,  and using these observations will aid in the separation of the emission from the surface  vs. the lowest atmospheric levels from the space-borne point-of-view.  A small number of  ground-based spectrally resolved remote sensors are operational; these instruments can be  used to improve and evaluate methods to retrieve PBL structure at high temporal  resolution from satellite sensors, which can then be applied globally.  [These sites include  the ARM instruments at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) supersite (1 Raman lidar, 5  AERIs and Doppler lidars over a 100 km diameter region), at the North Slope of Alaska  (NSA) sites at Barrow and Oliktok Point, and at Graciosa Island in the Azores, and at the  Lindenberg, Cabauw, Payerne, and Chilbolton observatories in Western Europe.]   3.1   Calibration/Validation  Remote sensing studies of the PBL will require calibration and validation support, much  of which is already in place or being planned at extensive field campaigns using new  advances in ground-based remote sensing platforms.  One such example is the ARM-SGP  supersite that includes numerous ground-based profilers as well as routine radiosonde  launches, and a number of proposed L-A campaigns with new instrumentation focused on  diurnal PBL monitoring.  One significant challenge is to characterize the surface  contribution (in both temperature and emissivity) to the satellite observation, and to     develop methods to separate this contribution from the emission from the lower  troposphere.  A complete error analysis should be included so that uncertainties in the  quantification of the surface contribution can be propagated to provide uncertainties in  the retrieved boundary layer profiles.   3.2    Synthesis with Other Platforms   The PBL is a key integrator and transport layer that links the water, energy and carbon  cycles and pollutants (gas and particulates) at the L-A interface.  As a result, routine  observations will enable closure of the PBL budgets of heat, moisture, and CO2 and at the  same time enable coupling of current satellite-based retrievals of individual variables of  the L-A system, such as soil moisture (e.g. SMAP/SMOS), land cover states such as  vegetation properties and types (MODIS, Quicksat), evapotranspiration and surface  temperature (MODIS, Landsat), clouds and aerosols (CloudSat/CALIPSO), precipitation  (GPM), dust and smoke emissions (Terra/MISR), and free atmosphere thermodynamic  profiles (AIRS/IASI).   3.3    Synthesis with Models  PBL parameterizations used in weather, climate and Earth System models generally vary  widely in terms of complexity and physical assumptions (as evidenced by the large  number of PBL schemes available in the community WRF model).  Single-column  models (SCMs) have not evolved significantly in the last 15-20 years, while LES and  cloud resolving models (CRMs) are being more widely developed but still lack extensive  observations needed for validation across a range of conditions and representation of  spatial heterogeneity.  Overall, these modeling assets would benefit from the process  understanding gleaned from observations of PBL structure and evolution over a wide  range of climatic regimes, including those of feedback processes such as cloud-surface  radiative effects and entrainment.  For example, the GEWEX local land-atmosphere  coupling (‘LoCo’) community has developed a suite of diagnostics to quantify the  connection of soil moisture to precipitation in models and observations, most of which  require or would benefit from information on the structure (e.g. PBL height) and/or  composition of the PBL.   4     Anticipated Scientific and Societal Benefits  The need to understand the direct and indirect (feedback) effects of natural and  anthropogenic activities over land at meso- (e.g., mountain, low-level jet, sea breezes,  and monsoon), synoptic- (e.g., frontal systems) and global- (e.g., El Nino Southern  Oscillation) spatial scales and seasonal-to-decadal time scales is of critical relevance to  commerce (esp. food, energy, and transport) and public and environmental health.  The  PBL is the region in the atmosphere where the influence of local terrain and terrestrial  processes and anomalies on large-scale atmospheric processes is felt, and the majority of  atmospheric water vapor, heat, momentum and carbon are transported within the PBL.  Observational evidence shows that the structure of the PBL can either suppress or support  the following:  extreme weather phenomena including, heat waves, severe thunderstorms,  and tornadoes; dispersion of environmental (e.g., dust and smoke) and anthropogenic  (e.g., pollution) emissions, and prolonged wetness or drought.  As such, an improved  representation of the PBL is a prerequisite for next-generation model simulations of     clouds and precipitation as well as extreme events in weather forecast and climate  models.      The diurnal evolution of the PBL is also strongly modulated by adiabatic heating by  absorbing aerosols such as soot and black carbon, while the dispersion of aerosol into the  free atmosphere is governed by the timing and strength of PBL lifting.  This feedback is a  key factor in dictating air quality near the surface, which has a direct impact on human  health, particularly in developing regions.  Improved PBL representation will directly aid  in pollution and air quality forecasts, which will extend the benefit of this effort to human  health and well-being.  Thus, Earth system models and end-to-end user models  benefitting from these advances will enable improved information for decision makers,  hydrologists, and water management agencies. This will also have a positive impact in  disaster management for the benefits of society and economy.      5     Key Science Community Involvement  Identified research communities: atmospheric sciences, atmospheric chemistry, climate  sciences, environmental sciences, forestry, hydrometeorology, biology, physics,  renewable energy (wind and solar), water resources engineering, hydrology,  environmental health, geospatial information sciences.

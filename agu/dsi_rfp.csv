Only a global observing system can provide the necessary insights into changing rates and contributing processes to reduce uncertainties in predictions.,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/15647/2289356/184-7a61c2991bcebb05f02021617f6a0b39_BoeningCarmen.docx156,James,Famiglietti,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Jasmeet Judge, Dennis P.
